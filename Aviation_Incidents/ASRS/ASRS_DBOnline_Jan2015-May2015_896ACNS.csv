The arrival coordinator position was also combined to me and I was handling those duties during this period. I spoke with a coordinator for Aircraft X via telephone. During this time we discussed his request for a parachute simulation just east of PHX. My understanding was this was going to be a simulation run with three passes dropping streamers. I advised due to departure traffic there may be a delay for his requested time but felt confident I could work out this request within our facility and PHX Tower. Aircraft X was airborne around the coordinated time. We held the Aircraft X aircraft for approximately 30 minutes due to departure traffic off of PHX. I coordinated with the PHX TMC to stop departures to allow for Aircraft X to make his run. Aircraft X advised our controller he would only need one run which worked out better for both P50 and PHX. After departures were stopped Aircraft X started his run. Once over the target Aircraft X advised his run was complete and would RTB [Return To Base]. Once Aircraft X was no longer in the departure corridor I released departures at PHX. Shortly after this; Aircraft Y started his roll and climb out. Tower called and advised Aircraft Y was making an immediate right turn to avoid parachute jumpers just east of Phoenix. I acknowledged this and advised the south departure controller. I also advised the FLM at this time. These jumps should be coordinated well in advance. Going forward I will need to verify that there are or are not jumpers during coordination.",,,,"P50 TMC describes a situation where an aircraft is supposed to make three runs over a target; then when airborne changes its plan and drops skydivers unknown to ATC.

Passing JOVEM (with a 12;000 foot restriction) I believe I set 11;000 for MSSLE intersection; but either set the wrong altitude; or bumped the setting down as I let go. Both the FO and I believe we pointed to the altitude alert button and said '11;000 and set;' but we were simultaneously switching iPad pages to set up the new ILS approach and coordinate it; and deciding to select the tail de-ice. I watched the aircraft level off through ALT CAP then ALT HOLD; but then ATC advised us we leveled off at the wrong altitude (10;000 instead of 11;000). We thought we were managing the automation; runway change; icing; and etc. fine until this notification.Fortunately there was no traffic conflict. ATC advised us to maintain 10;000; then gave further descent instructions as we proceeded for our approach. The workload for the 'descend via' in and MD80 is already high. Then we were given a runway change to load and brief. Icing and rapidly changing ATIS reports added to our workload. Finally; I'm not sure if the FO and I held hands on the altitude alert switch on this occasion or not; but several times we both tried to reset it; or neither of us did and we stared at each other until we realized who was supposed to do it. We are both trying hard to comply with the recent company procedure change; but many years of ingrained training is difficult to adjust in a short time. Also; I love the iPads; but sometimes it is an added workload to switch between pages at a critical time; where as in the paper chart days I could have had the arrival and the approach pages out at the same time. I'm not complaining here. I like the automation progress; and the FO and I both believed we were managing all the systems safely and adequately; but somehow the altitude setting slipped by us on this descend via clearance.",,"The Captain was flying the Jovem1 Arrival to DFW when we were surprised by a call from ATC stating that we leveled off 1;000 feet below our altitude; but not to worry 'no traffic issues' maintain 10;000. What??? The CA and I were puzzled; looked at the altitude alerter; saw 10;000; looked at each other and agreed he had set 11;000. We knew this to be true because he set it; pointed at it; and vocalized he was setting 11;000 for MSSLE. I agreed and stated that 11;000 was good; all the way to Siler. No excuses for not catching the aircraft descending thru 11;000; but both of us find it hard to believe the alerter was set wrong; since we had the verbal exchange referenced above. Did the alerter jump a digit? Doesn't seem likely. Did the alerter get accidentally bumped? I can't imagine that happening. As to task loading that allowed the level-off to be missed: this was an unusual morning with freezing rain taking place at DFW; and the surprise of being assigned 36R as our landing runway merely a minute or so before this infraction took place. The Captain was in the process of changing the FMS; I was in the process of opening up the Jeppesen page for the unusual landing runway and resetting my nav instruments; we were on autopilot; and really thought we were on top of things.Once again; not making any excuses; but my observations are that the new altitude alerter setting procedure is causing some confusion in our MD80 cockpits that will take a bit of time to iron out. We've all been doing the same routine for a very long time and are expending a lot of mental energy right now with our attempts to overcome our old habits. It's one thing to say 'just whoever gets to the alerter knob first; set it;' but when we bump into each other; or worse yet; hesitate just long enough to ask yourself the question 'am I supposed to set it or him;' the smooth flow of operation is interrupted. Add to it the fact that we're still getting used to the increased workload the RNAV approaches have dropped on us. Yes; the new cockpit procedures will soon become routine; and yes the new RNAV approaches are becoming easier.We were lucky today that departure traffic was light.Lesson learned: even a simple 1;000 altitude change needs to be closely monitored for a successful capture!",,"An MD-80 flight crew inadvertently set a lower altitude than the one assigned and flew to the improper altitude.

Noticing that Aircraft X was out performing the first departure I told the pilot I will call your west bound turn. Pilot acknowledged and when I saw previous departure was no factor I thought I instructed Aircraft X to start his westbound turn on the LINDZ8 departure (to be westbound in front of Aircraft Y that was on a 12 mile final) and to contact departure. In fact after listening to the tapes I failed to resume his left turn. After switching to departure he told departure he was responding to a RA with Aircraft Y on a 10 mile final.

When we are running visuals to runway 35; we must be aware of 'Tall ship' activity in the channel. If it is daylight; we must tell the pilot about the ship; its type and direction; and advise the pilot to 'Call the ship in sight'. After dark; we must suspend arrivals to runway 35 until such time that the ship is clear of the channel. River Watch (city of Philadelphia) advises TRACON OM of ship activity. Today I was working W; running the final to runway 35; during a very busy push. I hadn't been on position for very long at the time of the incident. During the position relief briefing when I took the sector; the controller being relieved did not tell me about any ships in the channel at the approach end to runway 35. Just after he unplugged and walked away; he came back over and told me that there was currently a ship in the channel. I made the 'Ship in the channel' call to an aircraft that I had just cleared for the visual; and switched him to tower. A very short time later I heard the supervisor say that the first ship was clear and that there would be another ship later. The supervisor did not make this call to me on a recorded line; nor did he make this statement directly to me; instead it was shouted in the room. I was very busy at the time. I did hear another controller ask the supervisor if the 2nd ship was due to arrive around sunset; to which the supervisor said yes. Because I was busy; I didn't look at the current time; nor did I try to determine what time sunset was. I figured the supervisor would advise me when the next ship entered the channel; and if it were due to arrive after dark I assumed he would give me a 'Suspend' time.A while later I over [heard] another controller elsewhere in the TRACON talking about the ship in the channel. I turned around and asked the controller if there was a ship in the river; to which the controller said 'Yeah; I think so. Any time now.' I asked what time sunset was and the controller said XA47z. I looked at the clock and it was XA47z. I heard nothing from the supervisor.  I turned and asked the supervisor if there was a ship in the river and he said 'Yes; but we don't need to suspend.' I told him that it was after sunset; and he told me that River Watch had said the ship would be clear before sunset. I questioned him again; because he had just told me there was a ship in the river and it was already after sunset. The supervisor again told me that the ship would be no factor. I didn't understand how he could be saying this; as there was a ship in the river (as per him) and it was after sunset. About that time the phone rang; it was River Watch advising that the ship was clear. It was about 2 minutes after sunset.In any case; I was not advised of this ship in the river ahead of time; as I am supposed to be. I had been running traffic to runway 35 with this ship in the river and had not been making my 'Ship advisories'. Furthermore; after the sun went down; we should have stopped arrivals to runway 35 all together until the ship was clear. This didn't happen. The supervisor's communication regarding the ships in the channel was terrible. I was not told about the 2nd ship; and clearly the supervisor was confused over what was supposed to happen at sunset.1. Supervisors should be required to advise the W controller of ships in the river; and suspend/clear times; on a recorded landline.2.

I could not see him out the window because of poor visibility but saw that he appeared low on the TDW [Tower Display Workstation]. The LA [Low Altitude Alert] did not alarm but I was about to issue one anyway because of his proximity from the FAF [Final Approach Fix] and the terrain.

TOMOK was the old fix that is still displayed on the map but the new fix FOLIG is in a different place.

I authorized the tug southbound on taxiway A and then authorized Aircraft X to taxi south on B to hold short of runway 16R at P.During this time I was scanning the LC1 traffic; and looking for the best opportunity to cross both Aircraft X and the city vehicle. I observed a C172 on short final for RWY 16R and also a jet about 4 miles in trail. I Coordinated with LC1; 'After short final Cessna; beat the jet traffic; Cross runway 16R at P and Q.'

The aircraft then proceeded to call the tower for a clearance through the bay for a transition and verified that they violated the airspace.

It was clearly unsafe nor order or expeditious to allow violators through the airspace and then to not be able to have the knowledge of the proper separation available.The controller needs to have remedial training.

After noting this we received an Auto Fail light on the pressurization panel. We proceeded to run the QRH and asked ATC for vectors and stay at 10;000 FT. Once we were directed to place the pressurization switch in standby mode we noted this did not fix the problem. I tried to ACARS Dispatch and contact MX Control on the radio with no luck. I decided to return to XXX for landing; as the aircraft would not pressurize. No emergency was declared. Upon extending the gear we noted a loud noise in the flight deck along with a vibration. Once we landed and returned to the gate I went out to check the E and E door and found that it was left open. There was no indication in the cockpit this door was open and the light pressed to test and checked normal. Maintenance met the aircraft and noted the same things and deferred the E and E door sensor. Double-check with First Officer that he was able to complete thorough preflight (with de-ice truck spraying the aircraft) during walkaround. Pay better attention when Crew Member is not familiar with the aircraft.",,"Upon landing; I turned my phone on; within 30 seconds; Scheduling was calling me; asking me to operate Flight X; XXX to XXX. I said no problem; Scheduling informed me it was due to depart in 15 minutes. I proceeded to the gate; and discovered I was the First Crew member to report. After checking in with the Agent; I asked about deicing for the active frost conditions; and was informed that we were to be deiced at the gate. I proceeded to the aircraft to check the logbook; and commence my preflight duties. I discovered; as the first person on the aircraft; the gear pins were already removed; but it appeared that Maintenance was just on the aircraft; and it may have been repositioned. I discovered that the APU was already running; was on the bus; and providing air; and there has been an alert for 'Duct Overheat' since arriving at the aircraft. I immediately turned down the left pack air temp; ran the QRH and reset the Duct Overheat alert. It successfully reset. I watched it for a few minutes to ensure it would not re-trip. After the safety check; I proceed outside to perform the walkaround. As I began; and I reached the nose of the aircraft; the Zone Supervisor and Assistant Station Manager were on the ramp; shouting to me to 'lookout; they are going to deice.' The deice truck had arrived and was prepared to commence deicing at the gate (before boarding). I got out of the way; and the operation began. When I resumed my walkaround inspection at the nose; I did make a point to examine the EE bay door; but did not notice anything unusual; in retrospect; I may not have gotten down to my knees on the deiced ramp to get low enough to look at the door clearly. I have several thousand hours on the 737 at another carrier; but I am not used to how low you have to get to properly ascertain the belly door is fully closed and latched on an old 737; straight wing aircraft. It is much lower to the ground; and harder to see. By the way; at 6' 5;' that is no easy feat anyway. The walkaround inspection completed; and deicing completed; I returned to the cockpit; the rest of the Crew arrived; and the Passengers boarded. We left in due course; no one feeling rushed. All checklists properly completed. We departed normally. On climbout; both the Captain and I noticed our ears popping. With the complicated RNAV Departure and a priority of flying the aircraft; we held off running any checklist until the aircraft was cleaned up. We shortly leveled off at 10;000 FT; told ATC we needed to stay at 10;000 FT and ran through the Pressurization 'Auto Fail' checklist. We had no control of pressurization in Auto or Standby and even ran the Rapid Depressurization checklist; despite that we did not have to don O2 masks or make an emergency descent. The pack and bleeds were in auto and the Air/Ground switch was verified in 'FLT'. We noted the outflow valve was fully closed. We had no lights; even ran a lights test; with no abnormal indications. We simply had no differential pressure; and cabin altitude was 10;000 FT. We did have an 'Auto Fail' and '''Standby''' indication on the pressurization panel. In standby; we still had no control of pressurization. We went to manual mode; and still had no control of pressurization. We ACARS'd Dispatch about the situation and suggested a return to XXX; which was agreed to. An emergency was not declared; we just needed to return for Maintenance. The Captain and I did a nice job splitting workload; I was very familiar with local XXX operations and reloaded the FMS for a return and approach to XXX and got ACARS messages to Dispatch while talking to ATC; while the Captain was talking to Company ops in XXX; the F/A's; and the Passengers. We accomplished a normal descent and arrival briefing and approach briefing and completed a Visual Approach. We noted a substantial increase in airflow noise as we lowered the landing gear; but all indications were normal. Landing and return to the gate were normal. Upon completing the Parking Checklist; we exited the aircraft; and discovered that the EE bay door was full open; and the cockpit light; while not burned out; indicated the door was shut. There were multiple opportunities to prevent this from happening. 1. Indication and warning systems are presumed to be functional when the airworthiness is signed off by Maintenance. 2. When an aircraft is returned to line service by Maintenance; either from a reposition or Maintenance checks; the aircraft should be verified (QA?) ready for line ops; and all Maintenance and service doors not in use should be verified closed; tools removed; connections made; etc. 3. The First Officer should catch a discrepancy such as an open door that is not normal (EE bay); which was specifically pointed out in training; despite the distractions of being re-Crewed; and deiced; and interruptions to the exterior inspection; and 4. The Tug Driver and Push Team should verify that all doors are shut and the aircraft is ready for flight. The failure to accomplish all four of these checks at the same time caused the air return. I cannot speak of the other three; but I was not as familiar with the older 737's; and thought I was doing an acceptable job of the inspection. Today's experience has shown that to not be the case this time.",,"B737-300 flight crew reports being unable to pressurize after takeoff.

The time that Crew Scheduling gave us did not make sense; and due to delays with aircraft boarding we were not even going to make the later incorrect time.  I told the Schedulers that my calculations had us past our contractual time and that I would not be flying the last leg.  After deadheading on the last leg and finally gaining access to a computer; I looked at the trip in Company Scheduling system; and noticed that they had changed the report time.  I notified Crew Scheduling and they put in a limo time to change the report time back to the actual report time.  After a very long day; it is challenging enough to figure out the legalities with the new FAR 117 rules;  and then to have the Schedulers illegally change the report time and base your legalities off of the changed time makes it that much more difficult.  In talking to other Pilots in the lounge; they said that similar events had happened to them.   I am concerned that this is an ongoing problem with Scheduling.  I believe if this type of behavior is not corrected then it will end up catastrophically.

We were assigned a speed of 180 knots to 'the bridge' and instructed not to pass the Airbus on the approach. The wind was out of the NE; thus giving us a quartering right tailwind during the approach.  The First Officer (FO); as pilot flying; opted to use no automation; and had been hand flying from about 10;200 feet MSL.  We were fully configured and stabilized well above 1;000 feet and right on glideslope.  All was normal until at about 800 feet AGL; we encountered some momentary wake turbulence that rolled us a little; but passed.  We then re-entered the wake and initiated the go-around.  The Pilot Flying (PF) advanced thrust and pressed TOGA; while attempting to maintain wings level.  Airspeed indications were erratic with the low-speed tape bouncing around and there was a momentary stick shaker activation.  Master Caution began sounding as EICAS displayed 'Windshear Fail; AOA Limit Fail; Stick Shaker Fail.'  With the high workload on the PF; I prompted the verbiage for the profile and we began to clean up the aircraft as we accelerated and began climbing; and full automation was engaged. The missed approach was reported to tower as 'due wake turbulence' and we were issued vectors for a second approach.  We completed the QRH procedures for all EICAS messages and were directed to complete a Flaps Full landing.  I then contacted the Flight Attendants to check on their status as well as the passengers; who were all ok; and then made a public announcement to explain the aircraft upset; go around; and what to expect next.  We re-prepared for the approach and landed without further incident.  After landing; the 3 caution messages cleared and were replaced by 2 cyan messages: 'ADS Probe 4 Fail; ADS Probe 2 Fail.'  Once at the gate; after shutdown; we referenced the QRH for the new messages; which spoke of a ground reset procedure prior to flight.  Rather than completing the procedure I opted to contact Maintenance with the write up.Two Major Lessons stood out from this incident.  First; with such closely spaced parallel approaches; ATC instructions to trail an aircraft that is upwind to us with a crosswind is very hazardous and warrants questioning.  Secondly; knowing when to use automation is as important as being able to hand-fly the aircraft; and due to the high workload and close spacing of the Tipp Toe Visual; automation increases safety significantly by allowing pilots to be more heads up.",,,,"Captain reported encountering wake turbulence in trail of an A320 on visual approach to SFO.

The aircraft APU bleed air was inoperative so we were required to use a start cart to start the engines at the gate before we could push. The start cart provided ample air and the left engine was started uneventfully. The second engine did not go so well. The Captain initiated the start with the right start switch and the engine spooled up normally. At N1 of 5-6% and N2 20-22% I engaged the right fuel lever and noticed we did not get a light off. I glanced at the fuel flow and told the Captain that I didn't think we were getting any fuel flow. After scanning the gauges and switches and trying to determine why the engine wasn't lighting off for approximately 5 more seconds the Captain commanded to abort the start. We successfully aborted the start and after discussing what had happened and how we felt we were not getting any fuel flow during the first attempt; we decided to attempt the start again after the engine spooled down from the first attempt. The second start attempt began normally and once again when the fuel lever was put into position the engine did not light off. This time I noticed and mentioned that we were showing fuel flow of approximately 100 pph. Once again; after approximately 5 seconds the Captain released the starter switch as he announced to abort the start. The second he released the starter switch the engine lit off. The temperature rose rapidly and I shut the fuel lever off as the temperature approached 500. The temperature continued to climb to approximately 520 at the peak and then quickly returned to what appeared to be a normal engine shutdown. Within 10 to 15 seconds after the engine was shut down we got a call from the tug driver announcing to us that his crew was reporting to him that our right engine was on fire. There was no fire indication in the cockpit and the captain began to spool the engine again in an effort to extinguish the tailpipe fire. After a few more seconds the Captain ask if the fire was out and the tug driver said that it was not. We pulled the fire handle and fired the bottle into the right engine. I called the ramp and ordered the fire trucks and explained what had happened and that we needed the agent to open the door so we could evacuate the passengers.",,"Capt. called back and asked if I saw smoke or fire coming from right engine. I looked out and observed ground personnel using fire extinguishers. I then saw either smoke or steam around right engine and reported to the Captain. He said ground reported that the fire was out but we would evacuate through the forward door with passengers leaving belongings. We did so.

They immediately assigned a heading of 120. A correction by the captain was established when the first officer told the captain he had the leans. After that the first officer reported the wind; which was not a factor. (The winds were calm to 10 knots) Soon after a heading of 140 was assigned. Once on the assigned heading the after takeoff checklist was completed. We were then given direct DAWGS.This was our last leg of the day; it was night; low IMC; and we had an early duty in.

This caused me to briefly experience the leans and I inadvertently banked to the left and got off the runway Heading. I caught it but we had drifted left of course.

Crew contacted Maintenance Control who advised condition was MEL capable. Crew contacted Dispatch as suggested who confirmed this status. MEL directs the door be restrained by holding door when opening from outside and using the door assist handle to lower the door from inside. The crew; admirably; posted a sign on the outside of the cabin door to hopefully avoid any injury or damage. This creates several potential situation which could cause serious injury to personnel and or damage to the aircraft. The door weighs more than 100 pounds and if not successfully restrained will hit the ground with significant velocity. This could result in: 1. Damage to the door when it impacts the skeg. 2. Injury to personnel when the door strikes them.3. With contaminated ramp surfaces the crew member may not be able to successfully restrain the door resulting in damage and/or injury.4.

A crew member lowering the door from the inside is in an awkward position physiologically and could easily receive an occupational injury or even be ejected from the aircraft.

Operating the door with it freefalling poses a safety risk. Not only could the door fall on the person opening it from the outside; but the procedure for opening the door from the inside involves using the door assist handle.

Since this was not able to be viewed/confirmed via our iPad; I asked for the appropriate approval documentation be forwarded to the aircrew. The only information we received back from Maintenance Control was info needed to complete the deferral. I then contacted a Chief Pilot; and asked if he could send me the documentation that this was now an NEF item. He forwarded us the same info. I then emailed him asking for the info. I never received a response. I have multiple concerns with this situation. First; I don't think it is advisable to operate an aircraft with this type of discrepancy with NO restrictions. Flights into known icing?  Reevaluate after each leg?  Something; anything!  There is zero guidance from the company on this aside from PIC authority and final decision maker. Secondly; it concerns me that the company is unwilling to provide documentation of a NEF classification that is not visible to the PIC. In my opinion; this is a not so subtle attempt to keep aircraft moving.  When I attempted to express my concerns and request for further documentation to both Maintenance Control and the Chief Pilot; I was repeatedly rebuffed. If this is now an approved NEF; certainly there must be written guidance stating this fact? I have no problem with an update to the NEF manual; but if the PIC is not able to appropriately verify/confirm this information independently; I think this is unacceptable. Maintenance is required to provide supporting documentation to a requesting PIC.",,,,"CE560 Captain discovers on post flight that a patch is separating from the primary surface on the left horizontal stabilizer device boot.

Subsequently; we switched to BOS center (freq 134.0) where we were told to 'Go direct KRANN and to fly the RWY 27 transition'.  Familiar with the arrival; we had not heard this phraseology. We misunderstood and thought we were cleared to descend and fly the transition and started to descend to be over KRANN between 11;000 FT and 13;000 FT and above 8;000 FT at ANSLY etc. as hard arrival published altitudes (not expects).Center observed us descending and had us level off at 21;000 FT. I inquired as to what 'cleared to fly the transition to RWY 27' means; did it mean we could fly the track and not the altitudes or the speeds? The response was that he didn't know and the controllers were waiting for training before they could give a 'Descend via' clearance; that all he could say was 'Cleared to fly the transition' and that the pilots were supposed to know what that meant. Once I realized ATC had not actually said 'Descend via' I realized we should have questioned the clearance before descending. As soon as we switched to approach we were given 'descend via the 27 transition'. Landed without incident. We expected to be cleared to 'Descend via' the approach then when we got different wording we 'Assumed' that we could fly the SID as published but obviously that wasn't what was expected.

We re-briefed the new arrival noting that this included this fix crossing that the ATIS had warned. The task saturation was quite busy during the descent.

I think the biggest mistake was to set the altitude preselect at the lowest hard altitude when there is a higher hard altitude to obey. If we would have set our altitude preselect at the highest hard altitude; the aircraft would have leveled off and then we could have set the next one after the level off. I recently finished OE on the CRJ 900 and I was taught to set in the lowest altitude; but this will not protect from this type of event. Setting the next hard altitude may be a better technique in this situation. Descend Via RNAV arrivals in general increase the flight deck workload many times over and exponentially increase the chance of deviations in aircraft without VNAV and auto throttles like the CRJ. Obviously this has been a problem at DFW since it was stated in the atis.",,"Cleared via SEEVR.1 RNAV arrival originally as filed. Briefed this arrival into DFW. Then after briefing this arrival we were cleared DCT RRNET and the BRDJE.1 RNAV into DFW. We were given a descend via clearance on the arrival. After passing PITHY above 11000 and at 250 I began slowing to 220 for STONZ and would have been at 8000 MSL at ROCKZ and 210 at the speed. I had 8000 in as the bottom altitude as set in from the beginning of the descent. I was advised as a course of action by other LCA and instructors as the correct course for altitude selection on RNAV arrivals. I missed the level off at 11000 at STONZ. I noticed this deviation at 10000 MSL and quickly slowed the descent and began the climb again to which the captain called ATC and notified them which they advised a climb to 10000 and level and they would give us the next descent. We complied and flight continued without incident. If there is a hard altitude on RNAV arrivals from now on I will be putting in the hard altitude crossing instead of the lowest altitude on the RNAV. Lowest altitude on arrival was 8000 MSL and that is what I had set in. Everything on the arrival was great until that point. That 11000 At STONZ was a hard altitude at 220 KNOTS. A clear and defined method for RNAV arrivals for us would be good. I believe we are getting a lot of mixed info as to these arrivals. In future I will make sure that any hard altitudes on arrivals are put into the Altitude selector. Also we noticed on ATIS that the airport had this particular fix on there as numerous deviations from aircraft descending below this fix. We are not the first ones apparently. So maybe looking into why this is happening would also be good.",,"CRJ-900 flight crew reports missing a crossing restriction at STONZ on the BRDJE1 RNAV arrival to DFW.

I announced my position holding short of runway 26 for takeoff and allowed an aircraft on final to land. I expected him to taxi back and listened for/received his taxi-back call out. Although I understood the call out I could tell that English was not the pilot's first language. I did not pay particular attention to the tail number said during that call out; as I could visually confirm his location. Immediately after; a second pilot gave the same call out; but instead saying 'back-taxiing runway 8'. The environment at the airport consisted of many foreign students in training; many of whom did not have English as their first language. Keeping this in mind I assumed that the second voice that called out a taxi-back was the instructor of the first aircraft clarifying their position; as I was ready to take off once they were clear.After hearing their clear call out and visually confirming they were off the runway; I called out 'ZZZ Traffic; [Cessna 172] departing runway 26 to the east; ZZZ Traffic'. I did not hear a response from any other aircraft in the pattern. I checked that the final approach end was clear and taxied onto the runway for takeoff. I took a quick glance down the runway; not expecting to see any traffic; and called runway clear. Looking down runway 26 at that time of the day included seeing a mix of the sunset and runway lights. Although these factors might have affected my ability to distinguish aircraft lights from runway lights; I believe I am at fault for not acknowledging this and giving the visual scan of the runway more attention.I began my takeoff roll and spotted the aircraft about 500 feet in front of me; his location was about 75 feet from the taxiway exit to the main ramp. I am unsure if that pilot did not hear my takeoff callout or if he assumed that he could clear before I started my roll but I did not hear from him after his initial taxi-back callout.By the time I spotted the aircraft on the runway I was only 4 knots below my usual rotation speed of 55 knots; so I elected to climb to avoid a collision instead of applying brakes and veering left on the runway at that high speed. I pulled back and banked slight left; getting airborne about 100-200 feet laterally from his position.

The turn from the current taxiway Delta to Golf was over a 90 degree turn. Without hydraulic steering; I was required to use differential throttle control to turn and as a result of this and the deteriorating conditions; I lost sight of the hold short line and stopped immediately.

At approx. 1000 feet AGL; FO announced 'before landing checklist is complete'. At low altitude we got a 'too low flaps warning' aural warning. This startled me; but I was tired and dialed in on this approach. Nothing seemed abnormal; and I had dealt with spurious GPWS warnings in the past; so I remained focused on the approach as we were very close to touchdown.The FO then pointed out that the flaps were actually indicating 20. He asked if I wanted to drop them to 25. I felt that would be destabilizing to the landing and I was carrying ref 25 plus about 12 knots at the time so I said no. I added a little power for 3 or 4 extra knots and touched down softly and uneventfully on the 12;000-foot runway.In hindsight the proper thing to do would have been to go around and set up a new and proper approach.

The aircraft seemed to be on a normal and safe approach when I realized the flaps were at 20 and not the briefed 25. I asked the captain if he would like flaps 25 and he indicated that he would like to continue. In retrospect I made 2 errors that I contribute to the insidious onset of fatigue. I failed to confirm final flaps per checklist procedures and I failed to call a go around once I realized we were not in proper landing configuration. The aircraft behaving in a completely normal behavior along with the low altitude we received the warning; further coupled with a 12;000-foot runway and the captain carrying extra speed on final led me to my mistake.

I thought this clearance meant to comply with the speeds and fixes but that all altitudes were waved with the new clearance limit. My First Officer apparently was under the same impression. I called and talked to my Chief Pilot to verify the details and meaning of this type of clearance. He was able to explain what the clearance meant and where we were wrong.

It was actively snowing at push time and during takeoff roll. After being disconnected from our tug; we were blocked from our taxi route for approximately 10 minutes as another carrier blocked our progress. Once in the south deice pad; we were the second Company aircraft to be deiced with the two-step Type I and Type IV deice procedures. We had planned a Flap 5 Max power takeoff; and the speeds where 137. 137; 140 something. After leaving the deice pad; and taxiing to the 1L; we held short of the 1L ILS critical area; then were cleared for takeoff on 1L. The runway was being reported 'Wet Good' but I mentally noted there was a great deal of snow/ice on the runway; particularly the left side of the runway. We performed all checklists and operated slowly and methodically to not rush. We were NOT in a hurry; but rather extremely vigilante and operated at a much slower pace than I normally operated. After waiting for both engines to spool up to 40 percent N1 and had achieved symmetric thrust; I advanced both start levers and selected TOGA. The aircraft accelerated rapidly; and approximately 80 knots; the aircraft nose turned to the left approximately 15 to 20 degrees and we were then accelerating toward the edge of the runway. I applied right rudder and right aileron but the aircraft did not correct. At approximately; 100 knots I knew we needed to reject or get the aircraft tracking back to the right.  Rejecting was not a great option given runway contamination.  I immediately grabbed the nose wheel tiller with my left hand turning it to the right and took my right hand from the throttles to apply right aileron. The aircraft responded and we tracked back toward centerline and rotated uneventfully. First; I think the 'Wet Good'; 'Wet Fair'; 'Wet Poor' and MU values are ridiculous to try to correlate. I don't even know if there is any standardization from the people who take MU readings; but I do know what I saw and took off on yesterday wasn't the same 'Wet Good' I see after a light summer rainfall.  I think our Training Department needs to educate our Pilots on exactly how MU values are calculated. I have quite a few questions regarding the MU values and the process to obtain these values.  I question the logic of MU values given; I have no clue how their values are calculated; nor if they are the best parts of the runway.  I want the MU values on the worse part of the runway; since I could find myself on the worse MU portion of the runway during takeoff and landing.  a) When an MU value is given; is there any requirement for the MU Truck Driver to drive down the most contaminated portions of a runway (e.g. the left or right sides) or do they stay in the center of the runway and do their braking on the cleanest portion of the runway? b) Do the trucks actually test the portions of the runways around 20-25\' from the runway edge or do they stay on the centerline? c) How often is a MU value required to be updated; when it is actively snowing or other frozen precipitin is falling? d) Has any Company Safety ever been in a truck when the MU truck does the brake action reporting in a place like MDW; BUF; in the middle of a snowstorm? We get RVR at up to four portions of a runway. I get RVR is an automated system versus a human driving down a runway and hitting his brakes in a truck. Every time I see a guy doing one; the truck is in the center of the runway; where the nose tire would be rolling; not the left and right main tires. This makes zero sense to me. Along with 'Wet Good' on a snow and ice covered runway in MKE being equal to a 'Wet Good' on a rainy July afternoon after a rain shower passes the field. 2) In XX years of flying both military transport aircraft and 737 s; I have never received any training on this type of event. I think this is a great training scenario. This event was not comfortable for me in any manner. Inexperience in the left seat of the 737 wasn't a factor. I have plenty of left seat experience in other aircraft on snow covered runways. I honestly believe the left side of MKE 1L was much worse than reported. Coupled with gusty winds and possible left wheel contamination that may have led to the left mains losing traction; all these factors made this a challenging takeoff.",,"I missed the 80-knot call due to looking outside and assessing the situation with Captain. Aircraft was airborne after that without further event. I made a report to Tower after takeoff with a barely 'Fair' runway condition. Captain called later with a 'Fair to Poor' assessment to help other Crews out because we did consider it a safety issue.This is my first landing in civilian world on a contaminated runway with what seemed to me packed snow/ice. Braking action reports seem to be very subjective. Need a firm requirement to have not only MU readings but maybe implement SAAB friction testers. We should be able to directly co-relate performance data with braking action instead of relying on subjective reports. I can't understand why packed snow would be called 'Wet-Good.' Also; not clear to me if MU reports are taking on the entire width of runway or a sampling. I flew for years in Europe and never encountered such poor runway conditions due to runways being very aggressively and pro-actively treated with chemicals that brought friction to 'Wet-Good.' We need a more reliable way of getting accurate runway condition data and also more detailed co-relation with performance determination options.",,"A B737 crew questioned MU value methodology and validity after departing MKE Runway 1L with a 'Wet Good' report; when poor controllability during takeoff indicated 'Fair to Poor' conditions.",

Flap extension on the ground was normal for departure as was flap retraction after takeoff.  During an aircraft status review inflight we noticed that the left outboard flap had an amber x displayed during flight with the left inboard showing 0.  The captain of the flight and I discussed the possibility of the Level 2 Flap Disagree alert occurring on our final approach.  During flap extension on final; the flaps tracked normally to the requested position of 15 degrees; then shortly after; the Level 2 Flap Disagree alert displayed.  Upon selecting the configuration synoptic; the flap position displayed 20/14/15/14.  We referenced the Level 2 Flap Disagree checklist; which directs the crew to place the flaps to the last symmetrical condition; which in this case would be Flaps 0.  The intent of this checklist is to deal with a flap panel that jams without continuing to its requested position.  This was not the case in this instance where the flap that was causing the Disagree alert was extending symmetrically; but then slightly overextending enough to trigger the alert.  Additionally; when the autopilot was disconnected during configuration no asymmetrical roll moment was noticed; leading the crew to believe it was an indication error.  With this mind set; we opted to continue flap extension to landing flaps with the final indication of 50/37/37/35.  We determined that the risks of landing with Flaps 0 far outnumbered the risks of continuing with the Flap Disagree alert and opted to operate outside of the AOM Level 2 Flap Disagree procedure.",,"The aircraft we were operating; had been written up on the previous two flights for a level 2 'Flap Disagree' message involving the left outboard flap overextending beyond its commanded position.

On approach on our previous flight the following scenario occurred: Upon extension of landing flaps 35 at about 1500 feet AGL on approach; a level 2 'Flap Disagree' was displayed with the outboard left flap indicator displaying 40 degrees. At this point we were fully configured to land on a stable approach and absolutely no un-commanded roll was experienced. Based on problems with the left outboard flap transmitter on the previous flight; the lack of any adverse flight characteristics; and the fact that normal and symmetrical flap operation had been verified by maintenance immediately prior to our departure; it was our opinion that the flap position was correct and the problem continued to be with the transmitting unit. It is my belief that an abnormally configured and high speed landing with less than landing flaps represented a more significant safety threat than continuing a fully stabilized approach with an aircraft that was handling entirely normal so I decided to continue the approach to landing. What's more; any further repositioning of the flaps with a faulty position transmitter would be still be subject to inaccurate position indications. At no time were any operating speeds or limitations exceeded. Maintenance later verified normal flap operations on the ground and again focused repairs on a faulty data transmitting unit. On our next flight with this aircraft; we noted that once again correct and symmetrical flap operation had been verified by maintenance as a corrective action from our previous night's entry in the aircraft maintenance logbook. Once more; maintenance identified and tried to correct a problem with the left outboard flap indicator position transmitter. When we reached cruise; although no alert was displayed; my First Officer noted that the left outboard flap position indicator was no longer supplying a signal to the flap position indicating system as indicated by a yellow 'X' being displayed in the left outboard box on the system display 'configuration' page. We interpreted this to mean that left outboard flap indicator was either inoperative or once again unreliable. We took the time to discuss the situation and review pertinent checklists and the aircraft systems manual and briefed our possible actions in the likely event we would experience a further anomaly when we configured the flaps for landing. Because maintenance had verified normal and symmetrical flap operations before this and the previous leg; a known recurrent issue with the left outboard flap position transmitter; and the fact that the suspect flap indication appeared to be failed; it was our belief that another disagree message in the absence of any adverse flight control issues was very probably another indication error. Since a level 2 'Flap Disagree' message is only as valid as the data being supplied to the flap indicating system; a bad transmitter unit would therefore render the level 2 message erroneous. I believe that predicating any checklist or configuration action based on known false; or highly suspect data would represent an unsafe situation. When we configured the aircraft to landing flaps 35 on approach we once again received a Level 2 'Flap Disagree' messages. On this occasion the left outboard flap position varied from a brief yellow 'X'; to values between 47 and 50.The first officer who was the FP reported no substantial un-commanded roll inputs and the aircraft was flying normally. Based on our discussion of known previous issues; the continued erratic indications of the left outboard flap indicator and the fact that the aircraft was stably established on rather short final; we decided to continue the approach to landing. As with the previous occurrence; it was my opinion that any configuration change or checklist procedure using invalid data was pointless and that an abnormal high- speed approach with minimal or no-flaps represented a far greater safety risk than continuing the approach to landing. Like before; at no time were any speeds or limitations exceed and preliminary inspection of the aircraft flaps on the ground seemed to indicate no actual asymmetry.",,"MD-11 flight crew describes operating a flight that routinely displays a flap disagree message when flaps are extended during approach.

When starting the aircraft we experienced a STBY HTR FAIL message on the Pilot/Copilot PFD's. This was a repeat write-up and previously addressed by maintenance. I do not know the reason this system failed; from my limited experience in the Phenom 300 this aircraft does not perform well after sitting cold soaked overnight. This aircraft was in the hangar prior to our flight; but I believe it was left outside overnight on the original failure of the system. The Airplane Flight Manual says: NOTE: If the battery has been cold soaked for 2 hours or longer at ambient temperatures of -10C or lower ; it must be preheated to -10 or above prior to engine start.  The AOM Engine Start; operators are directed to start the engines with a GPU when OAT is at or below -10C. At the beginning of this trip I noticed the conflict between the Airplane Flight Manual and the AOM. Knowing I was going to a cold weather area I called the Assistant Chief Pilot for clarification on this procedure. He explained to me that we should get a hangar when possible when cold temperatures were expected; if the plane is to remain outside overnight; we should get a GPU as directed in the AOM. He also said there is no way to tell what temperature the battery is; as there is no indicator on the plane. So operationally; it wasn't feasible to comply with the NOTE in the AFM. This is one of two occurrences this trip having faults with cold soaked Phenom 300's. Always park the plane in a warm hangar if conditions indicate it will be cold soaked. Comply with the AFM NOTE when the plane becomes cold soaked. Develop a procedure for testing the temperature of the aircraft batteries so that the NOTE can be complied with. Maintenance should audit cold soaked Phenom aircraft maintenance faults. Complying with the AFM by parking aircraft inside a hangar and warming batteries will probably lead to less failures and a higher maintenance availability rate.",,,,"Phenom 300 First Officer describes problems that arise when the aircraft battery is cold soaked below -10 C.",

They could not determine where it was coming from exactly but it was loud and went away after about 10 minutes after lift off. I informed the Captain and he asked a few questions about where exactly was it coming from; etc. by the time we started our descent; the noise returned; and we advised the pilots again. After landing and passenger deplaning; we asked if a mechanic was going to check the aircraft. The Captain said there was no mechanic at the airport. Now we are asking why he did not inform dispatch about the problem and asked for a mechanic to be called/ flown into ZZZZ? He did not write up the malfunction in the log book........we; all flight attendants; felt ignored and not taken seriously. After talking during our short ground time; the Captain; went to check the aft doors for any debris around the door frame....He also mentioned; that the only thing that had been written up in the logbook; that maybe had 'something to do' with the air leak was a hole on the floor of the cargo hold and had been speed taped. This had been written up in the log book back in September; 2014. Needless to say we; the flight attendants; were shocked.......honestly; we should have walked off the aircraft and refused to take it back. We did not have much time to 'analyze' or decide what we were going to do about the whole situation and went ahead and boarded the plane and on our way home. Again; on takeoff the air leak; ear piercing noise came back. Also; another strange noise was detected. Like a motor running constantly under the galley floor. Flight attendants in the back; described it as like the sound that the flushing motor in the lavs makes; and it was constant throughout the flight. They had heard it before on the previous flight but were not sure and did not mention it to the pilots. We have always been told that we are the 'eyes and ears' for the pilots......... We as flight attendants were undermined and ignored on that first leg. We feel that the Captain decided not to write up the discrepancy in the log book; after that first flight;  so as not to delay his flight back home....... Since they were only doing the turn and going home for the day. We knew there was no mechanic in ZZZZ but we did our part; informed of the high pitched noise (air leak) right as it was happening and expected the Captain to have maintenance check it out at our destination.

As Aircraft X was flying past the control tower and over taxiway at approximately 600 feet; I observed large flames coming out of the back of what appeared to be the left hand engine. This was followed with several very loud booms that could easily be heard in the tower cab even with all the noise insulation in the tower cab. I heard in total roughly 5-7 loud booms with roughly as many flashes from the engine in addition to flames shooting out the back of the engine. The pilot radioed that he was declaring an emergency due to a bad vibration and needed to turn around to land at the airport as soon as possible. The pilots then came back and stated they'd lost an engine and were requesting [the runway they had just departed from]. The conditions were VFR and I asked the pilot if they wanted to return and land on [the westerly facing runways]. They said they wanted XXR. I asked if they were able to maintain their own terrain and obstruction clearances so I could vector them below the MVA's. They said they would be able to and informed me that they would be leveling off at 1;500 feet. I issued a vector for Aircraft X to fly heading 360 to bring them back to the airport. I vectored the aircraft and continued attempting to get the pilots to get the airport in sight. As the aircraft was on the downwind it was reported that there was a possibility of FOD on the runway. I reported this to the pilots and asked if they would be ok with landing [on the left runway] instead. They agreed. I continued issuing vectors to the aircraft. As the plane was on a 5 mile base I turned the runway lights up to step 5 since the pilots were having a hard time finding the airport visually. They got the airport and runway in sight and I cleared the plane for a visual approach to runway XXL. As the pilots landed I asked them to state their intentions; they wanted to exit the runway and have the fire department examine the plane for any fire. As Aircraft X was off the departure end a flight of 2 fighter jets were on final for XXR. Their company informed them that there may be FOD on the runway so on short final; the flight of 2 went missed.

We continued on the ILS Runway 31L Localizer as a backup to the Visual; and continued descent to 2;200 feet MSL to intercept the Runway 31L glideslope at JAKID. As we continued; Regional Approach informed us of traffic (a Learjet) at 3;000 feet MSL on a right base for DAL Runway 31R. We initially responded we were searching for the called traffic and continued in-bound on the approach and continued slowing and configuring the aircraft. A few moments later; we both visually acquired the Learjet traffic and reported 'Learjet traffic; in sight' to Regional Control. Regional Control acknowledged our report and instructed us to contact LOVE Tower.

We were rescheduled on an aircraft that had been at the gate since the previous night.  In that time about two inches of snow had fallen on the field.  The aircraft was not de-iced prior to our arrival. The aircraft was parked at a ground level gate.  We were instructed to reposition the aircraft to a jetway equipped gate.  During my cold weather preflight of the aircraft I noticed 1-2 inches of snow and ice adhering to all surfaces of the aircraft.  I noticed large amounts of ice and icicles hanging from the leading edge of the wing.  I communicated my observations to the captain and taking into account current weather conditions we decided that de-icing and anti-icing was required prior to departure. The captain communicated with station operations and was informed that all communications with de-ice would be relayed through the operations office.  De-icing was to be done at the gate with the engines shut down and the APU operating.  As the captain began accomplishing other tasks in the cockpit I continued the communications with operations and informed them that a full body type I and type IV application was required. At the conclusion of a normal boarding process we determined that the QRH DEICING checklist was the most appropriate for our conditions.  We accomplished the checklist items line by line and informed station operations that we were configured for deicing.  Shortly afterwards we observed station personnel begin applying a yellow/orange fluid to the aircraft.  Later; what appeared to be the same personnel and vehicle applied a layer of green fluid to the aircraft.  We received communications through the station operations frequency that type I and type IV fluid had been applied and the aircraft was clean of all contaminants; satisfying their duties per FOMIt was at this time I received word that a deadheading crewmember was concerned that the aircraft had not been sufficiently de-iced. Upon hearing of this concern the captain and I discussed our options and quickly determined that we could not dismiss the deadheading crewmember's claim without further investigation.  From the flight deck windows the wing surfaces appeared shiny; clean; and clear of contaminants.  I volunteered to exit the flight deck and speak directly to the crewmember.  Upon reaching the crewmember's seat they informed me that; in their observation out of the window; the wing still had 'slush' adhering to the top surface.  I attempted to look out of the window but visibility was restricted by a layer of yellow/orange fluid.  Unable to see the wing in any detail from the cabin; I returned to the flight deck and requested the main cabin door be opened so I could check the wing directly.  We did not discuss contacting operations to have ground personnel re-inspect the aircraft.  The captain agreed that a close visual inspection by a crewmember was the best option; and I volunteered to exit the aircraft to perform the inspection.  Upon exiting I noticed the aircraft was covered in a mix of yellow/orange and green fluid on the entire fuselage and both wings.  I then walked to the left wing leading edge to begin my examination.  Upon reaching the wing I found that from approximately three feet from the wing root; to approximately nine feet from the wing root; large amounts of up to approximately half inch thick layers of ice adhering to the leading edge and lower surface of the wing.  I then inspected the right wing and found a similar amount of ice on the right wing.  I called the captain out to inspect the wing while I entered the building to communicate with operations personnel directly.  Entering the operations office I heard the captain's voice over the radio discussing the ice adhering to the aircraft.  I directly informed them that the de-icing had; in our opinion; been insufficient and a reapplication of both type I and type IV fluid was required.  I returned to the aircraft; andafter a subsequent de-icing application the aircraft was determined to be clean by the captain and we departed without incident.While the remaining ice that we saw was on a heated portion of the wing; we would not have been operating with the wing anti-ice ON until the final taxi.  I do not know if all of the adhered ice would have been cleared by the wing anti-ice in that time.  I also do not know if areas of the tail or other critical aircraft surfaces not visible from the ground were clear of ice.  This leads me to the conclusion that our takeoff would have been attempted with a wing that was heavily contaminated with ice.  The ground crew erred in both the application and the inspection of the de-ice process.  The ground crew failed at their assigned tasks; and attempted to dispatch an un-airworthy aircraft.I do not know what can be done; personally; to fix this.  We completed all checklists and followed all guidance from our manuals.  As a crew we performed our tasks as assigned.  It would be impractical to have a member of the flight crew exit the aircraft to inspect the de-icing process.  That being said; it is my belief; that had this deadheading crewmember not been paying attention and verbalized their concerns; we had a high likelihood of a catastrophic loss of the aircraft; crew; and passengers.

At some point on the arrival we were given a crossing restriction of F240 at BHAWK. A couple minutes prior to BHAWK we were re-cleared to descend via the FYTTE2 Arrival. As we were already nearing BHAWK I decided I would leave F240 selected as it was between the F260-F220 restriction at BHAWK and then continue the descent via the arrival after BHAWK. At this point I realized it was just past the hour and a new ATIS should be available for ORD. So; I thought I'd get the ATIS so I could begin briefing the approach into ORD. While focused on the task of reviewing the weather and approach; I failed to resume our descent via the FYTTE. Moments later; we received a call from Chicago Center asking if he had cleared us to descend via the arrival. The captain responded that he had and we would be unable to make the FL210-17;000 feet crossing restriction at STNLE. I immediately began a descent. Center responded with a new clearance to cross FYTTE at 11;000 and 300kts. This occurred just prior to crossing STNLE; which we crossed at around FL220-FL230.The root cause was my lack for prioritizing threats. Because of that failure; I was distracted with prepping for the approach. In hindsight; I do feel that a fatigue induced lack of focus may also have allowed this error on my part.There were lots of things I could have done to prevent this. First and foremost; as pilot flying it is my job to fly the airplane first. I should not have begun another task until I had not only planned for the next step in the arrival but actually waited and executed it. I could have asked the non flying pilot to get the ATIS. I also could have tried to get the ATIS 4 or 5 minutes sooner but was distracted by some minor flight deck conversation. I will say as an aside; that I do feel that the inconsistency in how arrivals are conducted in O'Hare does make this type of an event more likely. I don't think I have ever flown an O'Hare arrival as published. The altitudes and airspeeds are always changing. In the case of this event we were cleared with a crossing restriction; then re-cleared back onto the standard descent. I notice that having the routine of a consistent arrival keeps you thinking about the next fix. Most of the time flying the FYTTE arrival and really most arrivals in O'Hare we get a clearance for FYTTE at 11000 and 300kts; bypassing all the other crossings. I think more descend via's and less altering of the approaching in O'Hare would help keep me from making this mistake again; although that is no excuse.",,,,"A CRJ-200 was given an altered crossing altitude of at FL240 at BHAWK on the FYTTE RNAV STAR to ORD which was subsequently reversed and they were cleared to 'descend via' the FYTTE which included the restrictions 'Between FL260 & FL220.' Instead of reprogramming the pilot flying opted to wait until crossing BHAWK to reengage the descent; but failed to do so when distracted by other tasks. An altitude deviation at the following fix resulted; abated by a revised clearance from ATC.",

While performing the preliminary inspection on a Cessna CE560EP aircraft; I found the inboard end of the L/H aileron contacting the wing rib directly inboard of the aileron. The rivets and screws retaining the balance weight cover were gouging into the rib. I notified Maintenance Control. I recorded the damage and contact between the aileron and structure. The aircraft was outside in -8 degree temperatures and snow. The initial response for Maintenance Control was to grind the aileron to get clearance; because it was the busy season and our operator really needed the aircraft. That was not even an option in my opinion. Maintenance Control had a Contract Engineering company draft an Engineering Order (E/O) in which we were to grind down the rivet contacting the rib; and grant the aircraft 300 hours flight time before the repair was made. I forwarded the information to our company Safety Representative Mr. X. I also discussed this E/O with a senior inspector and we both agreed that this was not a safe option. The later E/O was to grind the rivet down; and fly the aircraft under Ferry permit to get repaired properly. Two days later we performed the repair per the E/O to ensure the rivet could not impede the movement of the aileron and performed a Ferry Flight inspection. Three days after that; I was notified by Safety Representative Mr. X that the aircraft had flown to our Base Station for repairs and the aileron was found to be the wrong part number installed three years prior. The CE-560 Illustrated Parts Catalog (IPC) has had many changes over time with the 560 series aircraft. I don't understand how the paperwork was missed during initial install of the aileron.

My enroute altitude was 5;500 feet and I was in contact with ATC all the way to DAB under VFR flight following. DAB Approach Control descended me to 3;500 feet at 20 miles out then cleared me to descend for my landing at my discretion. I advised DAB Approach Control I would descend at 10 miles out; and was approved for such. At 10 miles out; I began my descent and Approach control sent me to DAB tower. The tower cleared me to land on RWY 25R; and I echoed back the clearance. RWY 25R is the one typically used for the jets and air carriers while RWY 25L is typically used for the GA fleet. I should also note that this is only the second time I have landed at DAB in 13 months; so I am not very familiar with this very busy airport (air carriers; private jets and multiple flight training businesses). As I approached the field for landing; I saw I was beginning to line up for the 'big' runway at about 3.5 miles from touch down; and thought; 'Oops; head for the small one.' As I approached the centerline for the 'small' runway (25L); I saw a C-172 slightly above me (10 -20 feet); forward of my position by about 25 feet and a horizontal distance from me of about 100 feet. I banked right to avoid him and notified the tower of the traffic conflict. Tower immediately responded that I should be lined up for 25R; not 25L. I acknowledged the correction; and I then easily maneuvered to 25R. I landed safely in the first 1500 feet of the runway; and departed 25R at TXWY N7 (tower direction).

I told them my intentions to fly to WORIR then UMMAP which was the IAF for the RNAV 08 into 1R8 airport. I also informed TRACON that I was going to fly the Holding-In-Lieu-Of portion of the approach. TRACON's response was: 'Hold as requested'. WORIR and UMMAP are very close to each other; so once I hit WORIR heading 360; I informed TRACON that I would be making a left 270 turn in order to fly to UMMAP for the HILO which has an inbound course of 086. They said: 'Roger'. When I was approximately 2 miles west of UMMAP; my student became task saturated and the radios were busy; so I informed TRACON that I wanted to cancel flight following. I cannot remember for sure; but I think they said: 'Squawk VFR; frequency change approved'. I am certain that they didn't try to keep me on their frequency and maintain flight following during the approach. My student changed to ATIS to get an updated altimeter setting and then switched to the CTAF frequency for 1R8. He hit UMMAP and started the holding turn back out to the west. The holding pattern for the IAP depicts 4 nm legs. At approximately 3.5 miles and 2;000 feet MSL; I realized that I was very close if not already within the boundaries of the class C airspace ring of MOB and that I did not have the required 'Two-way' radio communication with TRACON but that I was cleared to 'hold as requested' minutes earlier. I made the turn inbound and mulled over calling up MOB TRACON after I had already left their airspace; re-entered it during the outbound hold; then exited again on the inbound hold. I did not call them to confess or clear up any confusion though as I could not think of how to communicate all this in a concise radio call that wouldn't jam the frequency for others. I was monitoring UHF guard for the whole flight but never heard anything from MOB on that frequency. I am unclear if I was in the wrong for re-entering Class C airspace while VFR during a HILO procedure of an instrument approach to which I had already coordinated with TRACON for. If I had to do it over again; I would have not terminated flight following until I was complete with the procedure and well clear of the Class C airspace of MOB.",,,,"Flight Instructor reports inadvertent entry into MOB Class C airspace during a practice RNAV 8 approach to 1R8 in VMC.

I was concerned with destination weather which was pretty much at minimums; with blowing snow and low ceilings; we had plenty of fuel and (to my knowledge at that time) a great aircraft. During the pushback; I couldn't talk to the Pushback Crew. I could hear but not talk. I rechecked the O2 mask; tried the #1 avionics panel and aborted start and told Ground Crew to standby. After trying the spare headset in the cockpit and having no luck with that; we had the Agent pull the jetway back up and call for Contract Maintenance. She did that while I initiated contact with the Operations Center/Dispatch. Anyway; I got them on the horn; told them my troubles with the COMM panel and they agreed after several quick trouble shooting procedures; (including asking me if the mask was working and would I consider using that for the flight) that having Contract Maintenance look was needed. Shortly thereafter; the local Maintenance Contractor shows up; swaps out COMM panels from observers panel to #1 and we still have no COMMS. Here is where the fun starts. I tell Maintenance that I am 'uncomfortable' taking an -800 aircraft; at high weights into a field with bad weather at or near minimums with snow on the ground. They say; 'Captain; that item is deferrable so we'll just MEL it and get you moving.' I tell them I'm not taking the aircraft under those conditions where I don't have NORMAL communications with my First Officer (FO). About this point they connect me with the Chief Pilot on Call. He was great; he didn't pressure me to take the aircraft; but he did line up options. One of which is that they may swap me out. Unbeknownst to me; they got Scheduling into the loop; and instead of heeding my concerns about weather and conditions (which as most Pilots know; will actually get worse right about early sunrise due to sun angle in the haze; mist and snow) they decide that the best course of action is to get another UNSUSPECTING Pilot to take an aircraft that I won't fly into those conditions in its current state. So the swapping starts and a Captain shows up at the aircraft not knowing what's going on. I tell him what is happening; and he jumps into the seat and whether he fixed/touched/moved something; I don't know but he says COMMS are back. We switch seats and sure enough; everything is working. I tell him to go back to his original aircraft; I call Dispatch tell them that we're now good to go and let them re-sort all that. We re-board all the Passengers and get under way about two hours behind schedule. The issue here is that Safety seems to have been left behind here. I had VALID concerns about abnormal COMMS in really pretty crappy weather conditions. They didn't care; they had MEL relief and they wanted to go. The undermined safety. I can think of a thousand things that can go wrong and without normal; smooth instantaneous COMMS with my First Officer; it can go sideways pretty quickly. But our Knowledge/Experience/Skills are discounted over schedules.  That's it; just that our inputs are not really weighed into the equation when the Company makes decisions without utilizing any of our amplifying information. More authority to PIC.  If he says it's not doable; no argument from Company Operations.  Get Mechanics/parts etc. headed that way after 'reasonable' trouble-shooting and discussion with the Chief Pilot on Call.",,"As the Captain called for pushback; he realized he was unable to speak on his side of the aircraft. We troubleshot the switches; headsets; etc.; even plugging in his set on my side; and trying the alternate headset from the seat back. After conferring with Dispatch and Maintenance; we tried the oxygen mask MIC which worked. Once the O2 mask was re-stowed; the boom MIC ceased function again. Contract Maintenance was called; and several procedures tested; including swapping out control heads; pulling and re-stowing the O2 mask and nothing worked. The weather conditions at destination were at minimums with precipitation. The Captain told Dispatch that he was uncomfortable taking the aircraft as-is into these conditions; a decision with which I concurred. He was on the phone with the Chief Pilot on Call; who asked me if I would be comfortable taking the aircraft with another Captain and I told him that I agreed with the many years of experience standing next to me. About this time; a new Captain; obviously pulled from another flight in order to take the aircraft we were scheduled for showed up. He sat in the Captain seat for a minute; and I'm not sure what exactly he did; if anything; but he said; 'it's working now.' We took the aircraft and flew it down to minimums and landed uneventfully. On a clear day; things look a lot different; but when the snow is flying and the visibility is at minimums; some things expand in importance. Under these conditions; a very experienced Captain told the Company he was uncomfortable taking a certain deferrable Maintenance problem into the current conditions. The decision to disregard his judgment and find another Captain with a somewhat different comfort level seems imprudent at best and hazardous to the Company's stated number one goal.

We slowed to 280 knots and went in search of the speed restriction since we had just briefed the STAR and did not see said restriction.The simplest explanation is that in order to read each fix on the arrival; we both had to enlarge the screen on the HAWKZ 4 STAR and the speed restriction was pushed off the screen.

I had come off of my rest break; received a briefing from the Captain and then the Captain went on break. We were East of 50W; established on NAT track U when we got a master caution EICAS message: R STRUT DUCT LEAK with R ENGINE BLEED and R PACK OFF sub messages. I ran the checklist from the QRH. We called the Captain back to the flight deck and briefed him on the situation. A satcom call was established to dispatch and we eventually had dispatch; Maintenance Control and a Duty Manager on the line. The satcom call worked well initially but then dropped several times making communications very lengthy and cumbersome. Discussions ensued regarding ETOPS legality; suitable diversion airports and; ultimately; our plan of action. We were not in ETOPS airspace at the time the strut leak occurred. However; by the time we ran the checklist; discussed the situation with dispatch; maintenance; and amongst ourselves; we were well into ETOPS airspace. The checklist states; 'Avoid Icing Conditions.' This was of particular concern because we were in the dead of winter over the North Atlantic and the entire East coast of North America was experiencing a winter storm. Gander (CYQX) was the only suitable alternate behind us. My main concern was a situation where we would to need to descend while on the NAT due to pressurization or engine issues. In this scenario we might well find ourselves in icing conditions for an extended period of time. Ultimately; the decision was made to continue to destination with a suitable enroute alternate (without icing) at LPLA (Lajes). Later in the flight we received an ACARS message from dispatch suggesting a diversion to ZZZZ (clear wx) as our destination was now experiencing and expecting icing conditions for our time of arrival. We were told that there would be an airplane available in ZZZZ to take our passengers on (not true). We then coordinated the diversion with Shannon Control and eventually landed there. I felt as though dispatch; Maintenance Control and a Duty Manager were pushing us to continue. In retrospect; I don't feel like any of the aforementioned parties had the whole picture/situation. I found the FM and QRH to be deficient in helping us determine 'what happens' when a Strut Duct Leak is detected. i.e. what valves close etc. I eventually found information that confirmed my thoughts that we would not have engine A/I available in this situation (Maintenance Control insisted we would). The QRH should state; 'Flight into icing conditions PROHIBITED'; rather than; 'Avoid Icing Conditions.' The latter does not convey the gravity of the condition. I also found the FOM to be deficient in referencing a 'short list' of items needed for ETOPS entry (not dispatch/flight planning but actual real world entry).",,"This report is to highlight how SATCOM and iPad manuals failed my team miserably. Just after being established on the NAT tracks (Passing 50W with CPDLC; HF established but before Extended-range Twin Operational Standards (ETOPS) entry point @ 50N44W) we received a 'RT STRUT DUCT LEAK' EICAS with the Right Bleed and Right Pack now disabled and the inability to heat the right wing A/I and a requirement to stay at FL350 or less. With the east coast experiencing a winter storm; our closest and only east coast choice for a diversion at this point was to perform a U-Turn on the tracks and go into Gander. This was strongly encouraged by one member of the crew focusing on whether we were legal to continue into ETOPs with no way of ascertaining a second pack failure and flying at 10;000 feet to an alternate and be able to avoid icing conditions with the resources we had at this time. SATCOM was established with dispatch; Maintenance Control; and the Duty Manager. These questions were raised along with getting confirmation from Maintenance Control that the engine AI should still work on the RT engine (turned out this was not true for us). (Now entering ETOPs) A quick reply was that we were legal to continue but while discussing other concerns surrounding the soundness of this decision; SATCOM failed. For a good 20 min of NO COMM we continued discussion in the cockpit with 1 dissenting on continuing. My thoughts centered around staying above the weather on the same course to Europe with the high possibility we divert into our alternate as our destination was expecting icing conditions. But other west coast European cities should be available as well and if we should end up descending en route with any more of a deteriorating condition; diverting to LPLA as opposed to BIKF would be an option to stay in warmer weather and we still had Gander night VFR behind us.The discussion now turns to 'Did we have all legal requirements to enter ETOPs?' We have 3;758 pages of manuals (FOM; FM; WOM) to sort through in a matter of seconds as we need to make this decision on our own because 5 other attempts on SATCOM failed. With ''ETOPs' entered in the searches of each manual; we are led to 684 pages to reference (not a speed reader!!). When entering 'ETOPs requirements'; we are led to 3 pages each saying 'Check ETOPs Requirements'!!!! Later in flight; a message comes from dispatch saying that after a round table discussion at Ops; it is suggested that we divert to ZZZZ as the weather at the destination will require anti-ice and there is an aircraft available there for us to continue; if Captain is agreeable. We reply YES and the coordination begins at coast in with Shanwick. Three hours pass before we fly over VFR conditions and begin our descent into ZZZZ. As we pass into conditions requiring engine anti-ice; it fails to come on. Our mechanics descended on our aircraft to determine whether it can be fixed with no option of ascertaining that aircraft we were promised. A three hour grounding occurred with all passengers on board. Our only hope for a fix was to replace the computer card monitoring the pneumatic system as a real leak would have ended here. SATCOM and ACARS messages for permission to perform an engine run-up for mechanics went unanswered. As the crew was focused on not failing the mission to continue; we performed the engine run-up without the permission of the company which is now FOM policy; but what were we to do? No immigration to deplane and no aircraft as promised was delivered and at this point we are just another ACARS nuisance to an overloaded dispatcher.",,"B767 flight crew experiences an 'R STRUT DUCT LEAK' EICAS message entering the North Atlantic Track (NAT) east bound. The QRH advises to remain clear of icing and a major snowstorm is impacting the Northeastern U.S. and by the time consultation with the company is complete the best choice is to press on with a new alternate. Destination weather deteriorates and a diversion to an ice free alternate is executed.",

The item was not written up in the maintenance history. I looked for guidance in the FOM but found none. Maintenance was on board and indicated that they had taken these actions. The purser stated that they had guidance in their FAOM. I reviewed what I was shown and it seemed vague; appearing to refer to stowage of materials on the flight of event. The mechanics stated that this was a usual procedure; to carry bio-hazard out of the country because it could not be kept in [the country of departure]. He said that was written in their manuals. I asked if he could provide written guidance and he told me it would take him a half hour.I contacted dispatch; maintenance control; and [the duty manager]. Dispatch couldn't find any guidance. I stated that I was fine with any action taken but that I wanted to ensure that whatever we did was safe and legal as I had never heard of this procedure. Maintenance control couldn't find any guidance; except to say that this has always been the procedure; to carry bio-hazard waste out of a country back to the U.S. and put it in an overhead compartment. I...had never seen this procedure but was okay with whatever we did as long as guidance could be shown. The Duty Manager couldn't find any guidance. I was told that a decision was made to remove the bio-hazard waste from the aircraft to expedite departure. The local mechanic stated that the aircraft had arrived this way and that the inbound crew had not written it up. My concern now became one of an undocumented maintenance item that I was aware of and the potential ramifications of dispatching without documenting. I spoke to the dispatcher again and it was decided to document the item in the logbook and have it deferred. I did this and learned from the mechanic; who was in touch with maintenance control; that the MEL deferral number he was familiar with which allowed for carriage of the bio- hazard materials seemed to no longer exist and that there was in fact no such guidance provided for any longer. I looked in the MEL and could not find anything either. In today's environment of potential lethal bio-hazards such as Ebola; and the resulting geo-political; health; and legal ramifications of the handling of such waste; it seems to me that the system broke down on a number of levels. 1) The inbound crew should have written up the items. Our having to handle this and resolve it caused us to be delayed.2) The mechanics and ground crew dealing with these items should have ascertained that everything was properly documented; and they should have noted it in the logbook if the flight crew had not.3) On my commuting flight home later in the day I asked the F/A [her manual] and did discover that there is a reference recently added which accommodates allowance for placing bio-hazard waste in certain areas; including the overhead compartment. I am happy to have seen this. However; this should be in the pilots' FOM as well.This is the second time in a month that I have discovered maintenance items which have not been properly documented and dealt with which caused; in this case a delay for departure on my flight and potentially unsafe conditions; and in the case of a flight last month an overhead sign that was broken and which wasn't documented but had been improperly rigged with safety wire instead of a proper bolt causing it to fall down during taxi; potentially injuring a passenger or crewmember; and then resulting in the cancellation of our flight because of the length of time it would have taken to fix it. I am concerned that seeing two similar events in the course of four weeks may be the tip of the iceberg of unreported and improperly dealt with maintenance.",,,,"A B777 Captain about to depart a security sensitive Middle East destination was advised by flight attendants of a bag of bio-hazard waste in an overhead bin that was intended to be transported out of the country.

We had a legal release; flight plan and all paperwork for a normal flight. Somehow; the flight was cancelled by dispatch after the release was generated and no one was notified.

Shortly after take-off; I called for heading mode; the command bars rolled to the left; and I started to follow the command bars. Tower immediately noticed us starting to roll to the left and said 'turn right; right heading 110.' I immediately rolled into a right turn. The tower controller caught our mistake so quickly that we only turned a few degrees to the left. I am very thankful the controller was watching us so closely; because we would have completely rolled in a turn to the left. The rest of the flight was uneventful. Turning left could pose a potential conflict with arriving aircraft; which is a very serious threat. I make it a point before every take-off to verbally confirm our take-off clearance; course; and initial altitude; so this is very frustrating. I must have got rushed and or complacent with the 'right turn;' because I did not register a 260-degree turn to the right. And to make things worse; the flight director commanded a turn to the left (the shortest distance to heading 110). The fact that the controller caught our roll to the left so early; it was as though he anticipated our mistake. Which leads me to believe he has seen this many times before. So this will not happen in the future I will make an extra effort to verify a right or left turn before take-off. But I would also like to have the tower controller somehow emphasize a right or left turn when a potential threat exists; such as greater than a 180-degree turn. Maybe stating 'verify right turn; right turn 110 cleared for take-off.' This would alert the pilots that a threat exists; a greater-than-180-degree turn and the autopilot/flight director may turn in the opposite or shortest distance to the heading bug.",,,,"Departing MDW Runway 22L; a air carrier Captain reports being told to turn right heading 110 degrees along with the takeoff clearance.

This is a major safety issue in several ways........1) it kills all the appropriate chemicals in your eyes that provide you with proper night vision to safely conduct night operations; and 2) It is so blinding that you cannot see the marshaller's commands. When I communicated to the ground crew to turn off the light; so I could see the marshaller; they did do so. The bigger concern here is that the station has mandated that this light be on for de-icing purposes. This light poses a HUGE threat to safety due to poor planning; and use of it. If the intent is to light the area; it needs to be on a 20-40 FT pole elevated in the air; shining downwards; NOT at ground level destroying pilots' night vision; and blinding the crew during night operations.

We deviated above the SPTNS altitude constraint. The issue arose from not setting 5000 feet MSL as our initial climb altitude and instead set 13000 feet MSL. We did not use vertical guidance on the SID thereby removing FMS vertical guidance and level off prompts from the flight director. Contributing to the issue was hand flying the aircraft and not selecting vertical guidance (VNAV) as the vertical flight cue. Corrective actions included compliance with ATC instruction; engaging the autopilot and reselecting an intermediate altitude on the altitude preselect system. The erroneous perception was to set 13;000 feet MSL as a top of SID altitude and not anticipate an intermediate altitude level off. The decision to hand fly; without VNAV guidance on a new SID affected human performance in terms of degraded situational awareness.

I moved over to assist the R-side to get through this traffic mess. PBI approach called later and asked if we stopped the aircraft or if he was NORDO. That was when we were notified that we had not pointed him out. I would pay better attention to the aircraft we have handoffs on. When I came over to be the D-side I should have verified with the R-side that the aircraft was pointed out to approach.",,"On the above date and time I was working R46 by myself. I had been working this position for about an hour already. There was weather over Miami extending south about 15 miles south of Dolphin VOR and 30 miles to the north. The weather extended north to about our border with Miami Approach; and due west about 30 miles to the border with sector 24. Airplanes were not transiting through the precipitation; and would only go due west from Miami. They would not go northeast at all. They tried to go north to HEDLY departure; but no one was going to the east from Miami approach. I had one or two airplanes that pushed through the precipitation to the northeast; but all outright refused. I told my supervisor that no one was going through the precipitation; and that none of our departures were working off of MIA or South. Sector 25 was refusing to work the departures; so TMU shut off the departures from Miami. The Everglades supervisor; came back to me and said that all departures are going out of HEDLY now. A few minutes later; Miami was basically free-flowing the departures out one gate. I was working all of the departures for WINCO/THNDR/HEDLY/ARKES with no D-Side; and no in trail. I had; on most occasions; about 5 miles; maybe less; between the departures as they came off of Miami Approach. This required me to vertically separate the traffic as it climbed. I asked for more in trail from my supervisor; and he gave me a D-Side for a few minutes before another sector got busy and needed him. Mr. X was my D-Side for about 15 minutes during this push. I asked for more in trail and was told 'it's coming'. During this push; Miami was basically climbing all Miami / South jets to 16;000 - and all Turboprops to whatever altitude they could coordinate. FLL jets were climbing to 11;000; and both out the same game. No one was able to go over HEDLY because of the precipitation; so everyone was over ARKES. Miami flashed me the handoff on Aircraft X. I can't recall whether or not they coordinated his altitude of 9;000 with me. I do not think they did; but I was also so busy that I can't remember. Aircraft X checked in level at 9;000 and I told him 'roger; higher shortly.' I had nowhere I could climb him; as I had no usable altitudes. With FLL having their jets climb to 11;000; he was stuck there until well further north. I should have pointed him out immediately to Palm Beach Approach; but at the time; I had 20 airplanes on my scope [The sector goes Red at 12] and no D-Side. Shortly after; my D-side; then returned from Sector 67. Miami was still free-flowing their departures; with little or no in trail. We were so busy trying to separate the airplanes we both forgot about Aircraft X being in the shelf. Aircraft X violated Palm Beach Approach's airspace and remained in their airspace until abeam PBI. Palm Beach Approach called and asked us who he was.Aircraft X was climbed without further incident. I worked another 30 minutes at the sector until being able to get a break.Staffing continues to be a huge issue at Miami Center and specifically in our area. D-Sides have to 'bounce' around from sector to sector as they get busy; because if we have all of the D-Sides staffed; or even a couple of the D-Sides staffed; we have no one on break. The D-Sides in this situation are not aware on what is going on with the sectors. They'll sit somewhere for 15 minutes; go to another sector; go to another sector; and end up at 2 more sectors before they get a break. In this occurrence; we had approximately 9 CPCs available for staffing. We had 6 sectors open; with 2 D-Sides available. That means 1 CPC is on break. Supervisors are not scheduling overtime; and we're getting the same staffing as we have had during the summer; even though our traffic counts are double what they were in the summer.Our shelf with PBI approach is from surface to 7;000 feet. ZMA Airspace built this shelf so Miami Approach wouldn't have to point out the traffic to Palm Beach Approach. In this case; putting an aircraft at 9;000 (with no coordination) is basically putting him into a boxed airspace canyon. It's an inevitable point out; and one that falls on Sector 46 when he doesn't check on or I can't climb him; as in this case. Miami Approach doesn't care that they put him at 9;000; because it's not their point out to make. I know of numerous ATSAP regarding Stratification of Miami Approach. I have even written one before. Having all jets coming out the same gate at different altitudes doesn't solve any problems; and it just allows 'less delays' out of Miami Terminal areas at the compromise of safety. Stratification wouldn't be nearly as bad as it is now; if it was treated as one DTAs; instead they treat it as a 4 DTAs; and approach shoves as much traffic out it as possible. This forces us to cap turboprops below the lowest jets - which is 9;000; and makes it an instant point out to PBI approach. We keep hearing the solution is metroplex; but metroplex is years off and the situation is dire now. Under the guise of Stratification; Miami Approach uses it to throw airplanes at us at any heading or altitude they like; without coordinating any of it. We can have two airplanes that were side by side and now given completely opposite headings and converging; all without coordination.",,"Two ZMA controllers discuss interfacility coordination procedures for aircraft out of MIA during high traffic departure period when foul weather limits available departure paths.",

On shutdown; there was a rumbling and vibration which all four pilots noticed and mentioned as unusual. Several minutes after block in; the mechanic plugged into the flight interphone and stated 'So you broke it'. We replied 'Not that we were aware'. The mechanic went on to tell us that they were going to replace the left engine. They had received ACARS data while in flight showing that there was a problem with the left engine. He also stated that they could hear the engine whining; as we came around the terminal; that it sounded really bad and there was a 'puff of blue smoke' that came out of the front of the engine on shutdown. Note that the mechanic did not say 'we need to inspect the left engine' or 'we are going to have to evaluate the left engine' he stated that the left engine was going to be replaced! Based; we assume; on the ACARS data downloaded while inflight. The aircraft was indeed grounded causing the cancellation of that days return flight. As of our departure the next day; there was a new engine being shipped over as well as a mechanic team to replace the engine. We had received an ACARS message from Maintenance Control about 8 hours into the flight. I was on second break with the captain at this stage of the flight. I did not see the ACARS message or see who it was from; Maintenance Control or Dispatch; the pilots on duty stated that Maintenance Control had been getting alerts sent from the left engine. The EGT and engine vibration was higher. They asked if everything looked normal to us. The pilots on duty sent back a message that all looked normal on the flight deck. That was the only communication I am aware of while in flight. There was nothing that lead us; or them; to believe there was a problem with the engine. After we heard from the mechanic on the ground we also noticed a fuel imbalance which was not there at top of descent as I remember checking fuel before we started decent. I am not sure but I remember the fuel imbalance was around 2000 lbs. More used by the left engine. It would seem to me that we clearly had an engine that was about to fail. I have other information which is hearsay but nonetheless relevant to this incident. During walk-around the next day; on the flight out; a mechanic approached the First Officer doing the walk-around and ask if he was one of the pilots that brought in the plane with the bad engine. He showed him some photos taken of the bad engine showing severe damage. The mechanic asked him why Maintenance Control didn't tell us to return. He told him we didn't get the ACARS message from Maintenance Control until about 8 hours into the flight. The mechanic said that he pulled up the engine readings for the entire flight. The mechanic stated that the engine was fine at level off but started sending some abnormal readings soon after that. Other relevant information is that the captain of this flight; saw the Chief Pilot by chance after returning from this trip. The Chief pilot said he was notified of the engine issue several hours before landing! It would seem that whatever they saw was bad enough to contact the Chief Pilot but not to inform the PIC. My concern from the limited information I have is that the captain and flight crew were not kept informed of possibly vital safety information regarding the condition of the left engine.

Almost halfway through our 6-hour flight we received a message from dispatch telling us we had to stop for fuel and could not continue on. After initially changing our destination to Airport ZZZ1; it was determined that turning around and diverting to Airport ZZZ offered us many more options once we landed. After landing at Airport ZZZ; it was determined that our flight attendants were out of duty period and with no FA replacements available in Airport ZZZ the entire crew was given rooms at the airport hotel and the entire crew was assigned the follow-on flight the following morning after minimum rest. The flight departed and we were back on our way. At FL360; mach .80; and 2 hours and 20 minutes into flight the STAB OUT OF TRIM LIGHT illuminated. The CA ran the QRH checklist for 'Stabilizer Out of Trim'. After disengaging autopilot and autothrottle; the checklist asks if 'Stabilizer Trim Responds to electric trim inputs.' After testing the control column trim switches multiple times both nose up and nose down; only once out of the five or six inputs did the trim wheel move. I don't remember which direction it responded to the input the one time it did respond; but it was determined that the electric trim inputs were definitely not responding appropriately. We also noted that no circuit breakers were popped. The last step led us to the 'Electric Stabilizer Trim Inoperative' checklist. Running this checklist had us 'cutout' both stab trim switches and disengage the disconnect clutch by having both pilots turn the manual trim handles. It was noted that significantly greater force was needed to trim nose down than was needed to trim nose up; but it was possible to trim the aircraft in both directions. The checklist then prepares you to plan for a flaps 15 approach and landing and explains that whether or not you have manual trim; elevator control would be sufficient to safely land the aircraft regardless of the stabilizer position. At this point we advised ATC that we were no longer RVSM compliant (no autopilot available) and were permitted to remain at FL360 for a while longer. The CA then began to coordinate with dispatch where we would land and Airport ZZZ2 was chosen. ATC had us descend to FL280 and flight characteristics all appeared normal throughout this descent. The CA and I discussed that in order to ensure that we were not given multiple restrictions on final (i.e. 'maintain 250 KIAS until 7-mile-final' or some other workload-increasing restriction) that it was in our best interest to declare an emergency with ATC and we relayed the appropriate information (fuel remaining; etc.). A short time later while preparing for the approach to Airport ZZZ2 we received word from the company that Maintenance Control was concerned with the difficulty we had with trimming nose down and wanted us to land sooner rather than later so we changed our destination to Airport ZZZ3 which was about 60 miles in front of us. We prepared for the arrival and approach and referenced the non-normal landing performance pages; and then completed the deferred items in the Electric Stabilizer Trim Inoperative checklist.

It is showing its age and is more prone to abnormalities and malfunctions especially in regards to the fuel; as it has a long pedigree of fuel related issues both self-induced as well as mechanical. Being sure detents are fully engaged and levers and switches are engaging as they should during all operations will help to maintain this vigilance. Usually we are not as focused on fuel balance during critical phases of flight because of the close proximity to the ground; density of aircraft; and more complex air traffic control. This may indicate a need to slightly rebalance our focus in an effort to catch such abnormalities earlier.",,"[Report narrative contained no additional information].",,"MD-80 flight crew reported landing with a 3;000 pound fuel imbalance that exceeded the 1;500 pound limit.

I transferred the controls to the First Officer (FO) and ran the QRH for the light. The stabilizer was not trimming and neither pilots yoke could control the trim electrically except for one very brief movement from the FO control wheel switch. It never responded again from either side. The checklist directed us to the Electric Trim Stabilizer Inoperative checklist. We also checked the circuit breakers to see if any were extended. All circuit breakers that weren't collared; were closed. We continued with the Electric Trim Stabilizer Inoperative checklist. Step 2 states: 'Use sufficient force to disengage the disengage clutch. Approximately 1/2 turn of the trim wheel may be needed.' It took both of us using a significant amount of force and approximately 1-1/2 to 2 turns of the trim wheel to get the clutch to disengage; significantly more than the QRH noted. After the clutch felt as if it disengaged; manual movement felt normal; although trimming the aircraft nose down felt as though it required slightly more effort. My FO and I spoke about this and attributed it to aerodynamic loads at altitude. We decided to check it throughout the flight regime to see if it changed. I informed ATC of our problem with the STAB trim and that we were not Reduced Vertical Separation Minimums (RVSM) compliant. ATC subsequently cleared us to FL280. During the descent I contacted ARINC to get a patch through to our dispatcher. Once on the line with dispatch he conferenced TOMC in to discuss the problem. We discussed the issue and I asked our dispatcher to help me locate an airport that was VMC; since we would be hand flying the aircraft and executing a flaps 15 landing. I also started to pull weather for surrounding airports. The solution was to head to ZZZ. I advised them that if we had any further change in the manual trimming of aircraft; that I would be declaring an emergency. I then notified the flight attendants of what was going on (T.E.S.T) and that we would be landing in ZZZ. I made an announcement to the passengers; explaining why we were going to ZZZ and assuring them that everything was ok. After the conference call; we discussed the descent and approach into ZZZ; reviewed all of the deferred item checklists and checked the Non-Normal Configuration Landing Distance table. We then checked to see if the resistance to aircraft nose down trim (A.N.D.) had subsided; it had not and in fact felt as if it were binding. Explanation: we would manually trim A.N.D. 1/4 to 1/2 of a full turn and the wheel would return to its starting point as pressure was slowly released from the handle. Note: if we were to let go of the handle the wheel would have surely 'snapped' back. This explanation is to illustrate the amount of resistance to movement to A.N.D. We checked aircraft nose up (A.N.U.) and it was markedly normal and very smooth. Trimming the aircraft A.N.D. was possible but required more force to effectuate movement of the stabilizer; also we would have to move the trim past the point where we wanted it to stop. We discussed this further and decided that there was potentially another issue. During this time; the aircraft was stable and completely controllable albeit requiring a bit more effort. I decided to have my FO look at the QRH and ensure that I wasn't missing anything; we transferred the controls and he started from the STAB OUT OF TRIM light and concurred with what we had accomplished up to that point. This gave me a chance to hand fly the aircraft and get a feel of the aircraft. The aircraft flew fine but when it needed A.N.D. trim; the added force required to trim while hand flying increased the workload and scan. We discussed the issues with trying to comply with approach clearances going into ZZZ; I decided to declare an emergency as this was a flight control issue and would allow us a longer approach assisting us in attaining a stabilized approach. We would also beable to slowly adjust speed and trim accordingly. I contacted ARINC and requested a phone patch to dispatch. I explained what had transpired with the manual trim and that I would be declaring an emergency. Dispatch agreed. I declared an emergency with ATC and explained the situation. After ending the call; I received an ACARS message to contact Dispatch again. I reestablished contact with dispatch and spoke to the FODM. It was explained to me that after my latest report on the manual trim; maintenance wanted the aircraft on the ground immediately as there may be a bigger problem. Dispatch said that ZZZ would be the closest and gave us the weather. I agreed and proceeded to inform ATC. We needed to lose more altitude and requested two 360 degree turns. During this time I informed the flight attendants as to what we were doing and followed up with a short announcement to the passengers. I decided that my FO should fly the approach as he had the most time flying the aircraft since the start of the event. He had been doing an excellent job and his stick and rudder skills were readily exceeding what was required. I asked him if he was ok with flying the approach and landing. He affirmed that he was completely comfortable with the approach and landing. Before we started the approach; I told him that if he felt any change in the controls and or pitch to immediately tell me; also that we didn't want many more changes to the trim once on the glide slope if possible. My FO landed to aircraft and we taxied to the gate uneventfully. All checklists were completed and write ups in the logbook were finished. I did not move the trim after landing to check its function as I didn't want to cause any other issues with the system. I felt as though our training in the simulator to include TEM and CRM helped in the successful outcome of this event. I tried to elicit ideas; thoughts and concerns from my FO throughout the event and he was a great asset offering the aforementioned. Last comment: We kept losing our patch with ARINC and or Dispatch; requiring us to reacquire communication. This was a large distraction and hindered our ability to convey information to Dispatch and for them to convey information to us. ACARS only helps so much. Also; while the iPads are an enormously helpful tool and I am thankful that we have them; they are only as good as the applications and processor speed. My iPad was fully charged when we left ZZZ. During this event; my Content Locker shut down twice and the JeppFD-Pro was very sluggish.",,,,"B737 Captain reported loss of stabilizer trim in cruise flight that affected both Captain and First Officer positions.",

Landing and departing aircraft were using runway 35. Weather was clear VFR with light winds. We landed on Runway 35; cleared at A3 and taxied south on Taxiway A toward Taxiway C. After landing and during taxi we maintained a listening watch for other traffic on the local Unicom frequency. We heard another aircraft (private non commercial small jet type; I think some kind of Beechjet) making numerous position reports for a landing on runway 35. There was a Airbus; a MD80; and a Q400 lined up on Taxiways A8 and D waiting to depart on Runway 35. While on Taxiway C; approaching the intersection with Runway 31; we announced on Unicom that we were crossing Runway 31. During taxi the First Officer and I were both watching for the (Beechjet?) aircraft that was suppose to be landing on Runway 35 and did not see him. Prior to crossing Runway 31; both the First Officer and I looked in both directions for approaching aircraft. Neither of us saw any so I turned on all aircraft lights and proceeded across Runway 31 toward the terminal building. As I entered the runway; the (Beechjet?) aircraft came on the frequency and berated us for crossing in front of him. The First Officer and I both spun our heads and suddenly viewed the aircraft on short final for Runway 31. At this time there was approximately 1 mile separation between us; while not a near miss it certainly was an uncomfortable and unsafe condition to be in. We informed the private aircraft that he was landing on Runway 31 and NOT Runway 35 as he had been broadcasting on the Unicom frequency. We expedited our crossing to clear the runway as quickly as possible. He continued his landing and did not go-around as he should have. Upon gate arrival; I queried the other airliners on the field to confirm that the (Beechjet?) aircraft was in fact announcing that he was landing on Runway35. Someone responded and confirmed that the (Beechjet?) aircraft was indeed announcing that they were landing on Runway 35.The First Officer and I spent a lot of time discussing this incident and trying to figure out how this happened and what we could have done differently to prevent it. We could not come up with anything other than to have seen the aircraft sooner; and I'm not sure how we could have done that; as we were watching for him. It seems that we did everything right. We were on the correct frequency; we made numerous position reports; and we listened and watched intently for other aircraft; and we looked before crossing the runway. This aircraft just appeared from nowhere. When we did see him; his single nose landing light was illuminated. We don't know exactly when he turned it on or if it was on before the runway incursion. The aircraft was small; and there is rising terrain along the approach to runway 31. During his approach to MTJ we heard him talking to Denver Center about needing to do some S turns to get down. The best we can figure is that he got high; started S turning and lost situational awareness of the location of Runway 35; and then lined up on Runway 31 thinking he was on 35. The small aircraft blended in with the rising terrain behind Runway 31 (from our view point) that obscured this aircraft preventing us from seeing it. The day following the incident we were contacted by Captain X; who was flying the Airbus that was waiting to depart on Runway 35 when this incident happened. He witnessed the event and offered his support and information. He confirmed that the (Beechjet?) aircraft landed on the wrong runway; and that he and his FO were looking for the aircraft as well and did not see it either. Everyone got lucky this day; however this incident further highlights an enormous safety concern I have always had regarding commercial airline service at uncontrolled airports.

I; Mechanic X; was directed by my Lead Mechanic to work with Mechanics Y and Z. Lead Mechanic handed me the task card with EC/RA attached just before our afternoon break. I placed the paperwork in my toolbox and locked it; then went to break. Immediately after break; Lead Mechanic met with myself and Mechanics Y and Z to discuss the job. Lead Mechanic told us that the new retaining nut and washer were on order and should be delivered within minutes; and to go ahead and set up for installation. At that time; we briefly went over the paperwork for this phase; and the Lead Mechanic told us the torque was 500 foot pounds. While I ordered the sealant as required; Mechanic Y went to the hangar to obtain the torque wrench for this operation. Upon his return; I set the tooling in place; put the nut and locking tab washer in place; spun it down by hand; and then engaged the tooling to begin the final torquing of the retaining nut. Mechanic Y read off to Mechanic Z that the final torque setting was 500 foot pounds and that the initial torque setting was 440 foot pounds. Mechanic Z then set the torque wrench to 440 foot pounds; showed the setting to our inspector; and then attached the wrench to the tooling. I held the tooling in place while Mechanic Y and Mechanic Z applied the torque to the retaining nut. Once the initial torque was reached; we checked the tab lock positions (myself and our inspector); and it was necessary to advance the position of the retaining nut by close to 1/4 inch to align the lock tab. Once we reached 500 foot pounds; the tab lock was still not aligned. The inspector instructed us to back the collar off; and then reapply the minimum torque of 440 foot pounds; and recheck the tab lock position. We continued this through four break/reset sequences with no better luck. Mechanics Y and Z and myself went to see the incoming midnight supervisor; and explained the dilemma. He took the paperwork and briefly perused it; then said that we should turn the issue over to the incoming crew. We turned the paperwork over to Mechanic A; an Aircraft Maintenance Technician (AMT) on midnight shift; and explained what problem we were having. Mechanic A left our presence with the paperwork; and then returned to me approximately 15 minutes later to show me that he read (after struggling with the interpretation) that the applied torque was to be no more than 500 INCH pounds. The paperwork as written (exactly) showed '500 lbf. in'; in the text. By this misinterpretation; the applied torque was 12 times greater than was intended in the operation.","Reporter stated there is a difference between Airbus and Boeing in the way maintenance information is presented to mechanics. References noting foot pounds and inch pounds are simpler and more clear-cut with Boeing Manuals. Boeing uses LB/FT for Foot pounds and LB/In for Inch pounds; whereas Airbus will reference Foot pounds Force with LBF-Ft and Inch pounds with LBF-In. Their Job Cards have the same information as the Airbus Aircraft Maintenance Manuals (AMMs); but in their situation; no diagrams/pictorials were included due to Airbus having sent the special tooling directly to Maintenance.  Most mechanics take about a year to learn how to use Airbus AMMs and not get themselves into too much trouble due to misinterpretation of the information they are reading. But; as his report shows; even experienced technicians still mis-read Job Cards.",,,"An Aircraft Maintenance Technician reports how misinterpretation of an A320 Job Card reference note contributed to a right-hand main landing gear side stay bushing retaining nut final torque being twelve times greater than specified.

I remembered that in January 2015; there was a write-up in the Aircraft Maintenance Logbook (AML) regarding a problem with both engine bleeds. When I looked in the Environmental Control System (ECS) page; I noticed that bleed 1 and 2 output was erratic and rapidly surging from 0 to 78 psi. I contacted local ZZZ Maintenance over the radio. I sent a message to dispatcher and copied Maintenance Control. The rate that the cabin was being pressurized was erratic. I made the decision to return to ZZZ due to safety concerns that we could lose pressurization at our cruising altitude (FL380). I sent a message via ACARS to the dispatcher [about] the diversion. No emergency was declared. No overweight landing performed (landed at 93;000 lbs. which is 4;000 lbs below maximum landing weight). I made an entry on the AML upon gate arrival in ZZZ.

After he returned to their departure airport; mechanics had asked him if he noticed the pneumatic cross-bleed valve was open during the erratic rapid surging? The thought by Maintenance was; if the Cross-bleed was open; then possibly the bleed valves on each engine were fighting each other; causing the surging. The only indication he had occurred during their takeoff roll when he noticed a Pack 1-2 EICAS message that happened very briefly and went away; no fault messages appeared. At the same time he did hear a surging noise that sounded like a window was open. As they were climbing he could feel pressure bumps as the surging increased. He decided to return to their departure airport. The ERJ-190 does not have a Fuel Dump System. Reporter stated the ERJ-190 aircraft uses a System Logic approach in the pneumatic system that opens and closes pneumatic valves automatically through an onboard Air Management System (AMS) computer that gives priority to the APU Bleed valve. Flight crews can switch to the opposite Pressure Controller; but do not have a 'Manual' control feature that allows pilots to manually adjust cabin pressure. Maintenance did perform a lengthy cabin pressurization check; suspecting the AMS computer; but ended up taking the aircraft out of service; the Corrective Action fix was unknown.

My sleep on the night before could best be described as decent; not great; but okay. Late in the morning of this day I began packing for my three day trip that began the following morning. I live in ZZZ and have been commuting to Chicago for just over a month; having recently changed domiciles. I had briefly looked at the weather in Chicago; it wasn't awful; it was marginal at best with some strong crosswinds. I figured things would be delayed; and based on the delays I saw earlier in the morning; it didn't look like much. Although; due to the weather forecast I thought it would be a good idea to give myself multiple flight options (4-5) just in case there were any issues. I showed up for the first flight that departed around XA35pm. It was delayed an hour. When I finally spoke with the gate agent she said the jumpsuits were full and I was #11 on the stand by list; it didn't happen. Just a short while earlier; the flight had many open seats and very few stand by passengers listed. After they began rerouting passengers and canceling flights; this flight began to fill quickly. Option for flight #2 was an Air Carrier Y flight; that I had been listed for; left around XB30. I ran to that flight just to learn it had been canceled. I ran back to the other terminal to try to catch the next Air Carrier Z flight. This would be the third flight I tried; since I had missed the first two. I would ultimately get on. Boarding began at XB:15pm; however scheduled departure time was now showing XD:15. We boarded - then deplaned - then re-boarded again. After it was all said and done we finally pushed off of the gate around at XE34pm and after an uneventful flight we touched down at ORD around XGpm. After exiting the runway we headed toward the 'penalty box' due to ALL gates being unavailable at ORD. We sat there for well over two hours waiting for our gate. When we finally pulled up to the gate; my watch read XJ05 am. Needless to say; ORD was an absolute mess. I headed for the bus shuttle center to catch the hotel van. Two of the vans came by; dropped off; picked up and left. But there were so many other people waiting in a huge line for the Hyatt. I called the hotel and was informed it could be well over 45 minutes or an hour before we would be pick up. At this point I was fighting a loosing battle with fatigue. At XJ40; I realized that I would only have a few hours at most for a sleep opportunity; followed by almost 8 hours of flying later that day. I knew then that I was fatigued and was not fit to fly for a XO25 show time. In the interest of safety; I decided that I must take action to remove myself from the sequence. I called scheduling and was removed from my trip. I waited about 30 minutes before deciding to just pay for a cab to the hotel. After a mix up at the front desk and after waiting in another line there for 30 more minutes; I walked into my room and the clock read XK44.I am writing this report to bring light to some of these types of issues that can arise while commuting and the fatigue that is associated with commuting. I must admit I was briefly hesitant to call off fatigued right away because I was afraid of loosing the pay credit for my 3 day trip (18 hours worth). Ultimately; I determined the most correct and responsible thing to do was to remove myself from the trip as it simply was no longer safe for me to be reporting to fly that morning per Vol 1.",,,,"Air carrier First Officer reported he chose to call in fatigued because he was unable to obtain proper rest prior to his flight assignment.",

Someone finally plugged the headset into the correct receptacle or got a working headset and I then established communication with the tug driver. The tug driver asked for parking brakes released. I said no because there may be tension in the tow-bar. I did not want to release the parking brakes and have the airplane lurch rearward and injure a standing flight attendant. I request that the tug driver put his tug in natural. He said he did. Then I asked for him to set his brakes. I then said my brakes were released.

On approach in VMC FO was slightly high on glideslope and slightly fast. In an effort to reduce altitude and airspeed autopilot and auto throttles were disconnected. I was unaware of this. Speed brakes deployed. Speed rapidly decayed; and stick shaker activated. I pushed up the throttles as FO retracted the speed brake. Stick shaker stopped; remainder of approach was stable.

We were lighter than planned and climbed up to FL370 right away. After getting into New York airspace; they asked us what we wanted for a crossing altitude and Mach #. We replied FL370 and Mach .83.They asked if we could climb to FL 380; we hemmed and hawed; and said we could do it; but preferred to stay at FL370. They then asked us if we could do it by JOBOC. We said yes at M.840. We then amended the speed request to M.85; said we would do it at M.85 by JOBOC. A deal was done. The previous was on VHF voice. We passed JOBOC AND 4160N. We got a Control-Pilot Data Link Communications (CPDLC) request to climb to FL 390. We rejected that request due to aircraft performance' We then got another request to descend to FL370 by 1258Z. There was a second page to the request that said we had a route change. There was a 'LOAD' prompt. We thought we accepted only the altitude change; and activated the 'report level' function. Be aware that we had been negotiating on altitudes only up until this point. They snuck this route change in with no prior notification or warning or an 'advisory' message stating that our original clearance had changed. The 'LOAD' prompt was selected; and the new route populated the CDU. Right away we got an 'insufficient fuel' message. We looked at the new route; and it had us starting two (2) way points BEHIND our current position. We looked at the new route (the first page) and thought it was the same route so we erased the 'new route before we activated it thinking that was an erroneous fluke. As best we can guess; on page 2 of the new route; they had changed the coast in point from LIMRI to ADARA. At 1435Z; somewhere between 5130N and 5220N we received a CPDLC request to contact Shanwick on HF. They asked us our route after 5220N and we replied 'LIMRI' They said that was wrong; we were supposed to be going to ADARA. Then they called back and said we could continue to LIMRI but they would be filing a report. The 'system' caught the error before any deviations were committed.I suggest that ATC not give a route change without an advisory warning. And to not give a route change when the previous request was an altitude change only. All via CPDLC. When getting a voice oceanic clearance; we are required to acknowledge explicitly that we have a different route than our original clearance. This is not so with CPDLC. As a side note; we were requested by the company to accomplish some manual revisions prior to departure which we were NOT able to complete; so; we were trying to finish the revisions in cruise. We received two ACARS queries from the company wanting to know if we had completed the revisions. We were a bit distracted trying to accomplish the company requested non-operational duties; and that may have distracted us to a point where a mistake was made.",,"Even though no deviation from a clearance actually occurred; if this is how it all happened; which seems to be the most logical; then it appears to me that New York's practice of issuing multiple changes (i.e temporary FL change and a route change more than one thousand miles distant) in one Controller Pilot Data Link Communication (CPDLC) communication is an unsafe practice that lends itself to many misinterpretations and errors.When sending amended or revised CPDLC clearances; send only one (1 item) per message to acknowledge. I.e. altitude; speed; or route/fixes; only one per message; not multiple as this form of communication is very simplistic and doesn't lend well to complex clearances.",,"Following extensive pre-departure negotiation with ATC; re-flight levels and Mach numbers for an Atlantic crossing the flight crew of a B747-400; was chagrinned and confused when; while enroute and after coasting out; they received a Controller Pilot Data Link Communications(CPDLC) message from ATC reclearing them by a different route which when 'loaded' per the CPDLC prompt started at a waypoint several waypoints behind them.

I looked up at our descent progress and we were on profile to reach REBIT at 17;000 feet. I inserted the arrival in the Flight plan; and then realized we were not going to make REBIT at 17;000 feet; and announced as such to the pilot flying. I realized then that he was typing to activate the secondary which he had briefed as a backup. There were two Coway arrivals that would work for 33R; so I just thought it would be faster for me to insert the arrival in the primary flight plan. We never made REBIT at 17;000 feet and never heard anything from ATC. The First Officer told me upon debrief that the FMS went to Vertical Speed mode when I started typing; but he was focused upon activating the secondary flight plan.

We have 2 methods whereby this can be obtained. One is through our on board FMS system. The other is on iPads thru ARINC (Aeronautical Radio Incorporated). I chose to use the iPad. I saw the clearance for departure as the LULUZ 2 with ABQ transition and programmed the FMS as such. Unknown to me at that time what I now think I had done was looked at the filed route and mistook it for the cleared route. On the iPads the ARINC PDC is formatted as follows. The first line in small non bold print is the ATC clearance. Located immediately under that in much larger print and in bold is the ATC filed route. What I believe now is that while filling out my TOLD card my eyes going back and forth to the iPad I mistakenly looked at the bold print and wrote down the LALUZ 2 ABQ transition. That made sense as it was what I filed. The actual clearance was the FTHLS 2 ABQ transition. With the actual clearance printed in the small print I believe my eyes focused on the bold printed line which was the filed route.So we departed 7R and once airborne engaged the autopilot and selected NAV. The aircraft crossed the first fix SPRKY and proceeded NE to FORPE. Soon after beginning the turn the controller called us to verify we were on the FTHLS 2 Departure. We stated we were given the LALUZ 2 as we believed was the truth at that time. He instructed us to turn to a 080 heading and join the FTHLS 2 Departure which we complied with immediately. As the flight continued and I had time to reflect I made the determination after reviewing the iPad PDC that I had mistakenly programmed the filed route as opposed to the cleared route.Approximately an hour later when on with ABQ Center were given a phone number to call upon arrival. I immediately called upon arriving and spoke to the supervisor at PHX Approach Control. I told him everything I have stated here. I also asked him to confirm that at no time did we bust an altitude or have any other traffic conflicts of any kind. He assured me that he had reviewed the event and that there no traffic conflicts or altitude violations of any kind regarding this event.",,"It was interesting that the PHX controller on the phone stated that they have as many as 3 departure issues every week by airlines and part 91 alike.

Approach control pointed out traffic; a 777 on final for 7L; which I reported in sight.  As we passed the 777; approach control turned us to a heading of 040 and cleared us for a visual approach to 7R with instructions not to overtake the 777 and to plan to land long.  We intercepted final just west of Fire Island; approximately 6 NM from the threshold of 7R.  We were level with the 777 at that point. We had the 7R ILS tuned for backup guidance; so I instructed the first officer to stay at least one dot high on the ILS glideslope.  I checked the wind vector on the HSI; which showed a 19 knot wind from the right; and the last time I looked at the glideslope pointer; it was showing almost full deflection high.  When we were fully configured for landing and slowed to final approach speed; the 777 was faster and was moving away.  As I watched the 777 moving away from us; I became aware of how far the parallel runways are staggered.  The threshold for 7L is well beyond the threshold for 7R; and I became concerned that we might not be staying high enough to avoid the wake turbulence.  I considered that it might be a good idea to tune the ILS for 7L to ensure we were remaining above that glideslope; and checked the wind vector again; which was now showing a 9 knot wind from the left.  It was very shortly after that that we encountered the wake turbulence.  It rolled us first rapidly to the left.  Although I'm sure the first officer reacted; I immediately took the controls; applying full right aileron and maximum thrust.  The roll to the left stopped and was followed by a rapid roll back to the right; which continued well beyond 90 degrees despite full left aileron deflection.  The roll stopped and we returned to wings level; climbing.  I retracted the flaps to 20 degrees and reported to the tower that we were going around.  They instructed us to climb to 2500 and turn right to 200 and asked the reason for our go-around.  I continued cleaning up our configuration; retracting the landing gear and flaps; then asked the first officer how he was feeling.  He said he could take the controls; so I returned control to him; then signaled to our passengers that the situation was under control.  We were sent back to approach control; who gave us a turn to downwind and a descent; then cleared us for a visual approach.  We landed without further incident.As I reviewed this incident later and looked at the airport diagram for the Anchorage airport; I came to the conclusion that it is not possible to follow a heavy aircraft in this situation with anything less than standard radar separation.  Because of the way the runways are staggered; effectively applying normal visual wake turbulence avoidance procedures produces a highly abnormal and potentially hazardous situation even if the wake turbulence is successfully avoided.Runway 7R is 12;400 feet long.  The threshold for runway 7L; just estimating from the airport diagram; is roughly 6;000 feet beyond the threshold for 7R.  If the heavy aircraft lands 1000 feet beyond the threshold for 7L; and we plan to land 1;000 feet beyond that; it leaves something slightly more than 4;000 feet of runway on which to stop.  While that is well within the capability of the Lear 31; landing on the last third of a runway is not something we would ever plan to do in any normal circumstance; and is well beyond what anyone would normally consider a long landing; as we were instructed by ATC to plan for.In future similar situations where normal visual wake turbulence avoidance is not practical; I think it would be advisable to request standard radar separation before accepting a visual approach in order to ensure there is sufficient time for the wake turbulence to dissipate.  It seems to me that ATC should really be aware of this situation as well in order to avoid placing lighter aircraft in a position where following a heavy aircraft is practically not possible.",,,,"LJ31 Captain reported encountering wake turbulence while on approach to ANC Runway 7R.

This is a somewhat common practice on the midnight shift to expedite traffic; with the 23R runway heading departure getting a right turn over the airport to the east. This practice is almost exclusively for [name removed] aircraft only. I turned Aircraft Y left direct MAREO intersection which turned Aircraft Y into Aircraft X's flight path.

We have automatic leader direction changes in our stars equipment here and I made a terrible assumption that Aircraft Y was off Runway 23L; not runway 23R. There had been no previous coordination from the tower or in the briefing of this unusual operation. I sat down; changed to my preference sets and immediately recognized the error. I instructed Aircraft Y to remain on runway heading and turned Aircraft X to a 140 heading. I watched both targets and their tracks to see if Aircraft Y had turned.

With the RED for DAL it would usually mean that one should look closely at possibly getting an AR7 (or final controller for DAL) depending on other traffic for that position.Well today there was a need for that position as not only was this controller working all of the DAL traffic by himself; he was also working numerous aircraft across the 'south airspace' inbound to GKY which was also very busy for the Cowboys game and other VFR arrivals to DAL and HQZ/RBD. It was so busy to GKY that TMU stopped all DAL arrivals from the SW corner to keep them out of that traffic and rerouted them either northwest corner or se corner. This Dallas South controller was so busy that the center kept calling with handoffs because they were still flashing and he was just too busy to keep up with taking all of them from the center and other sectors within.He also was not taking handoffs from me until the last minute due to volume. I tried to help as much as possible by answering his lines and trying to get the supervisor to take some kind of action. I advised the supervisor that he needed help and he advised me that there was no one else to open that (AR4 or DAL final) position! The Feeder didn't help the situation as they continued to 'drive' the traffic toward DAL final from the base (even though it was obvious that he was not taking handoffs) and didn't even slow them down or vector them out south to go behind other traffic (although I do not know how busy they were either).This was an unsafe situation and totally uncalled for! Either have the people here for the traffic or cut the flow rates to keep the situation safe! Everyone knows that when a person stops taking handoffs or is waiting until the last minute to take them that they are just overloaded and that is when accidents can happen!Staffing! Either have the staffing here to work the aircraft or curtail the rates to a manageable point! There should never be a situation where a sector gets overloaded and it could be split off but there are no people to do it! If the sector is overloaded; cut the traffic flow! The Cowboys game is a known event; staff for it! No excuses. If you don't have the people to call in on overtime due to the insufficient facility staffing; then cut the rates and let the chips fall where they may!",,,,"D10 Controller reports of another position being inundated by traffic and taking late handoffs.

As pilot flying I disconnected autopilot and autothrottle and complied with 'Adjust Vertical Speed' RA.  I was unable to regain a stabilized approach; so I called for a missed approach to include the verbiage 'Set Missed Approach Altitude.' Tower assigned an altitude to climb to which is the reason for this report. The pilot monitoring (PM) dialed (and he believes read back) 9;000 feet in the MCP. When climbing through approximately 8;000 feet MSL; the Controller notified us he assigned 7;000 feet. The PM insisted we had been cleared to 9;000 feet. We were then assigned a departure frequency and received vectors back to Runway 35L for a landing. When ATC declared we had climbed to the wrong altitude; I thought back and could not remember what clearance was given. I must have been task saturated with the missed approach and did not adequately focus on hearing the clearance. I am fairly confident I verified 9;000 feet in the MCP; but I was not aware this was possibly the wrong altitude. I recently watched the video about the low airspeed incident during a go-around and was in the 'Yellow to Red' trying to ensure I did the steps correctly which diverted attention from hearing the clearance consciously. Perhaps a preventive measure would be mentally 'chair-flying' the steps more often so it takes less mental capacity.",,"During the approach to Denver; we received a TCAS Resolution Advisory (RA). The Captain complied with the RA and stayed above glide path. As a result; we were unable to meet stable approach criteria by 1;000 feet. The Captain initiated the go-around.

I read back the clearance and reset the altitude in the MCP to 9;000 feet. As we reached 9;000 feet; Tower called us and said we had been told to maintain 7;000 feet.

I turned the seatbelt sign on immediately and at the same time stated; 'Flight Attendants be seated immediately. We need everyone seated now.' The word immediately had just left my mouth when we hit severe clear air turbulence. Our altitude was 240 and it was less than 10 seconds from warning until encounter. We climbed back up to 24;300 FT with no improvement; however; that allowed our airspeed to decrease from Mach .72 (280 knots) down to .67 Mach (245 knots). At the lower speed; we continued the descent to FL200. The severe intensity continued down to FL200 with no relief. We requested to keep descending and found relief below FL200. I checked on the Flight Attendants and was told of possible Passenger and Flight Attendant injury. We told ATC about the severe turbulence encounter seconds after it started. We soon after told ATC that we had 'possible Flight Attendant and Passenger injuries.' We were asked by ATC if we were declaring an emergency. I said; 'Yes; we are; due to precaution after severe turbulence and possible injuries onboard.' ATC asked if we needed assistance for aircraft or passengers. I responded; 'Aircraft controls and systems all appear normal; so no aircraft assistance needed on ground; however; we do need paramedics for possible injuries in the cabin.' On final approach to Runway 27R; in IMC; snow; ice and weather at minimums; the Controller advised us that braking reported 'NIL' by aircraft in front of us. We executed a go-around and shot the approach for 27L with fair to poor braking. Very slow taxi to gate due to ice on taxiways. Passengers and Flight Attendant were bumped around pretty badly in the cabin; however; no Passengers were injured other than one man who hit the floor a couple times in aft galley. After the flight; he told me he was okay and felt good. Then he added; but I don't know how I will feel tomorrow. One Flight Attendant was cleared by Paramedics; but wanted to go to hospital for x-rays of her arm. All tests and x-rays normal and she was released with no injuries. The Passengers and Crew were extremely lucky with this outcome. The Flight Attendants did an excellent job.As far as flight deviations; our airspeed was plus and minus 60 knots and our altitude was plus and minus 300 FT to 400 FT. We also deviated off course slightly left due to coming off LNAV/VNAV. This turbulence occurred in beautiful weather with a cloud layer below us about 10;000 FT or more.The biggest problem in this entire event; in my opinion; is the late heads up from the Controller about moderate turbulence. By receiving this alert at the time of the encounter; due to being at the exact altitude being warned about; no one onboard had any time to prepare. That was information of extreme importance.",,"Several aircraft had reported turbulence up to moderate in the descent; most reporting improvements out of FL210. No precipitation was depicted on the scope. I reported this to the controller at sector 12 and asked that she not assign high speeds to the arrivals. Pireps were also entered into ERIDS and the supervisor notified of each report.When the B737 checked on; I reported moderate turbulence in the descent reportedly improving below FL210 and cleared them to descend to FL200. They read back the clearance and began the descent. A moment later they reported that they were returning to FL240 due to the turbulence to reduce speed. They subsequently climbed to FL241 for at least one hit. One of the pilots stated that they had encountered 'let's call it borderline severe'. I cleared the aircraft to...15000 and gave them speed their discretion and the aircraft began descending.I reported the turbulence to the supervisor and the A side entered the pirep. When I returned my attention to the scope; I noted that the 737 had deviated north of course. They had descended to approximately FL205 and requested lower. I again cleared them to cross JAYBO at 15000; then amended the clearance to cross HEDGE at 15000 and direct HEDGE. At this point the pilots reported that it was severe turbulence they encountered and that there were passenger injuries. I reported this to the supervisor and asked the pilots for any more information they had. The pilots did not give any further information before the next sector requested communications with them and I shipped them.One more aircraft flew through the affected area before all arrivals were rerouted and did not report either moderate or severe turbulence.",,"Minor to moderate injuries were reported by flight attendants and a passenger when their B737 encountered 'severe' turbulence during descent for landing.",

As the pilot not flying (PNF); I was errantly thinking 'maintain FL230;' which would have been an unrestricted climb. The pilot flying (PF) was hand flying the departure; so I dialed 230 in the MCP and perceived I coordinated with the PF to delete the intermediate altitudes; thinking they were no longer necessary. The PF apparently wasn't really hearing what I was saying because he verified the steps before I executed them. He was busy hand flying and watching the altitudes on the departure and attempting to comply with them. Because I had deleted the 12;000B restriction at SHOBO; the flight director was climbing steeply toward that restriction. The PF attempted to level off there; still (correctly) believing we needed to comply; but the climb rate exceeded his ability to smoothly level off at 12;000 and we overshot the level off at SHOBO by 300- 400 feet before correcting down. The Controller seemingly did not believe we were leveling off; so he issued a vector away from the fix and asserted we had been cleared to 'climb via' and not an unrestricted climb. After I acknowledged the vector; he cleared us to climb unrestricted to FL230.I made errant entries to the FMC because I mixed up the definitions of climb clearances. Ironically; I had just reviewed the study guide regarding the 'climb via' preceding a 'climb and maintain' altitude earlier in the day. Perhaps my mind had locked on the answer to that question and thought this was the same situation. In the future; I will need to double-check my thinking of such clearances. I will also reconsider the PF's task loading in coordination events where I want him/her to verify something while they are hand flying. Looking back at the climb definitions I certainly knew what each meant; and have periodically reviewed them; yet I still misapplied them in this circumstance.",,"On takeoff roll; I lost my navigation and heading display. After takeoff; my navigation display returned and continued the departure. After flap retraction; I tried to engage the autopilot and was unable to do so on the First Officer's side. Was able to engage to Captain's side and while troubleshooting ATC gave us a heading of 100. We misunderstood while troubleshooting and the Captain selected a heading of 010. ATC prompted us on our heading and told us that was incorrect. ATC then gave us a turn back to heading 010 and assigned us a lower altitude of 13;000 for traffic on the arrival. We continued on the EEONS 4 RNAV; in LNAV/VNAV with the autopilot off. Just prior to ROYYL; ATC instructed us to climb to FL230 via the SID. The instruction was misunderstood; and the pilot monitoring deleted the altitudes in the FMS. I noticed there may have been an error in the climb instructions so I referred to the SID on my Electronic Flight Bag to comply with the altitude restrictions. As I was checking to see what altitudes I needed to comply with next; I overshot the altitude at SHOBO (at or below 12;000) by approximately 350 feet.When having an issue with the PF's instruments; next time I will hand the controls to the non-flying Pilot prior to troubleshooting. No loss of separation and we continued the climb out.",,"B737-700 First Officer (FO) experiences a navigation display failure during takeoff which quickly corrects itself once airborne.

I said to the First Officer (FO) 'we just lost an engine' as I looked at the EICAS and saw the ITT (Inter-Turbine Temperature) of Engine #2 climbing through 1;100 degrees Celsius. The FO was the pilot flying; so I told her that I'm pulling back thrust lever #2 and to disengage the autopilot (AP) and get trimmed up. Simultaneously; ATC called with climb instructions; at which time the FO reported the lost engine and declared an emergency. ATC asked if we would like to return to the airport. I took over the radios and said yes. (Although it would have been preferable to hold off on notifying ATC until more troubleshooting was done; the fact ATC happened to call at this time with climb instructions prompted the FO to report our engine failure and declare an emergency. I felt I would go ahead and respond; although briefly.) We were given a right turn and descent to 16;000. I wanted to assure that we were stable before maneuvering; so I spent the next few moments observing to make sure we were properly trimmed before re-engaging the autopilot and started the turn and descent. I requested and the FO agreed that she would focus primarily on flying the airplane while I handled the checklist and other pertinent items. While this was occurring; the Flight Attendant (FA) also called to ask us if we were aware of the loud bang. I told her we lost an engine and were returning to the airport and I would call her back as soon as I could. Precisely the same time; ATC requested souls on board and remaining fuel. I told ATC to standby as I verbally diagnosed whether the engine failure was severe damage or otherwise to determine the checklist to run. I checked N1 and N2 and saw there was still rotation; checked oil quantity in Engine #2; 12 quarts remained; and observed there was still a small indication of oil pressure. Also; I felt and heard no unusual vibration and observed that Low Pressure and High Pressure indications were in the green. The ITT indication was now dashed; but there was no indication of fire. Based on the above; I ran the Engine Failure/Precautionary Engine Shutdown checklist. We continued to get descent and vector instructions from ATC. We were originally given direct to ZZZZZ Intersection for the ILS 8R; but was offered RWY 27 by ATC. I asked for the WX and was told calm winds and ceilings and visibility above minimums. It was a bad WX day; with low ceilings and some moderate cells in the area; so RWY 27 worked better for us. I asked for and received some vectoring to get around the stronger cells. I called the FA back to give more details. I let her know time to touchdown; and no brace and evacuation would be necessary. I also requested that she make an announcement to the passengers regarding our return as I felt the priority was to complete the set up and briefing of the required instrument approach. (She was calm and professional; and based on the customers reactions at the gate afterwards; handled the situation in an outstanding manner.) Again; prioritizing my time and duties; I requested ATC to notify the company of our emergency and airport return. The FO flew the approach; the aircraft was configured and the checklists were completed in a timely fashion. I did call the FA one last time and she stated all the passengers were secure and the cabin was prepared for landing. We broke out right around 300 feet AGL and landed without incident. After exiting the runway; we requested ARFF to circle the aircraft to ensure the aircraft was safe to taxi to the gate. They cleared us; and we taxied to the gate. Obviously there could be a very long discussion about threats; errors; and undesired aircraft states in a major event such as this. I believe the most important reaction is to relax; fly the airplane; establish strong communication among the crew members; identify the issue; and resolve as best you can without creating even larger issues by diverting your attention away from flying the airplane. There are always improvements that can be made on any flight; not only in emergency situations. The events were discussed afterwards among our crew and I am certain we will all be better for it. I am proud of my crew and overall I think they did an outstanding job.",,,,"An EMB-145 engine failed during climb through FL190 so an emergency was declared; the QRH completed and the flight returned to the departure airport.",

I looked my release on my phone and noticed that the dispatcher planned us to operate the flight with enough fuel to land with approximately 2500-2600 pounds. I also noted that there was only 76 pounds of fuel in EXTRA. I called the dispatcher and said we were going to have to raise the fuel so we would have enough to deice. After some discussion; he raised my TAXI fuel to 500 pounds and EXTRA to 100 pounds. That was sufficient since it was a slow period for ramp operations at that time. We also had a discussion about a new policy where dispatch is to not put fuel in the EXTRA column. I explained to him that without fuel in the EXTRA column of the release; it is impossible to leave the gate legally unless you are over-fueled. We need that gas to start engines as well as run the APU during boarding at the many stations that don't hook up ground power. He just said that is changing and to deal with it and to email my chief pilot. After arriving at the airport and looking at the release a little closer; I noticed that at our arrival time at destination the TAF at that time showed 008OVC up until XA00Z and then improving to 020OVC. It was currently 006OVC; lower than the TAF indicated. I called the dispatcher back and requested an alternate. He then proceeded to argue with me that I didn't need it. I explained that; while 020OVC technically didn't require an alternate; I thought it a prudent idea. The weather in the mountains is fairly unpredictable; especially in the winter and at night; the TAF's change often. If the TAF didn't hold up; I would have ZERO options. In hindsight; the TAF required an alternate since we were within the '+/- 2 hours' part of the regulation requiring one. An hour prior showed 008OVC. The dispatcher continued to argue with me. I inquired about GJT or DRO. He told me he couldn't because their weather was too low. I told him that he was making my point for me. After several minutes of back and forth and arguing; he said something like 'Fine. I'll show Airport ZZZ but you are wasting a ton of fuel and you can explain to the two people you are going to have to kick off.' I thanked him and hung up. As we pushed back; we saw the TAF change to show 004 OVC. As we flew to Airport ZZZ1; we listened to the AWOS continuously. The weather continued to deteriorate. By the time we hit the FAF for the ILS 17; the AWOS called for 002OVC and 3/4sm. When we landed it was at 1/2sm. I just happened to see the runway a split second before the First Officer started to call the missed approach. The threats here as I see it; are the fuel policy and dispatch. When pilots call and request fuel for good reasons; we should not have to plead and argue with a dispatcher that wants to dictate the flight to the crew; as opposed to working with the crew to operate the flight safely and legally. I feel the only reason I got the fuel I got from the dispatcher was because I refused to hang up the phone until he did it. I should not be made to feel guilty and use passengers as leverage to not take fuel when necessary. I also should not have to argue if we are truly using the 'most conservative approach prevails' policy. I had valid reasons why the fuel was necessary; that should have been the end of the discussion. If I had let the dispatcher have his way; I would have arrived at ZZZ for an ILS with a decent chance at a missed approach and nowhere to go. I would have landed at our alternate with less than 100 pounds; I avoided an undesired aircraft state because I stood my ground. What would have happened if it were another captain that is more easily persuaded.The company needs to revise their policies on putting the absolute minimum gas on flights. Too often; dispatchers will want us to drop holding fuel before takeoff if taxiing gets too tight; or other measures to trim the gas. While I understand the intent of what they are trying to accomplish; why put the flight crew in a position of painting ourselves into a corner before we even leave the ground. While we have many fantastic dispatchers; we need to rid ourselves of the philosophy that some have where dispatch dictates terms on a release and we are to just be happy and fly it. When a PIC has a legitimate concern; the most conservative approach prevails.",,,,"EMB145 Captain reports having to cajole his Dispatcher into providing enough fuel to safely fly his flight to an IMC destination.",

Boarded with two passengers and one crew (myself). Completed the safety briefings and then the pre-start checks. Upon cranking the right engine for start the left main gear collapse. When mechanics arrived and lifted the left wing up and placed it on a jack; the right gear then collapsed. After raising the right wing the nose gear started to retract; but was saved in time by tying the tail down. It is suspected that the anti-retraction valve or some valve inside the main hydraulic housing may be at fault.","Reporter stated all three landing gears showed down and locked with three 'Green' lights prior to his attempt to start the Right Engine. The twin engine PA23 AZTEC he was preparing to fly has only one Engine Driven Hydraulic Pump (EDP) compared to the 'F' Model AZTECs with two EDPs. Flaps and Landing gear are all hydraulically driven with the landing gears having hydraulic priority over the flaps. That decision is controlled by a priority valve inside a hydraulic module under the floor. The Anti-Retraction switch on the Left Main gear that he referenced in his report is similar to a Squat switch. Reporter stated their Engine Start procedures include placing the Flap handle in the 'Up' position before cranking the Right Engine with the only hydraulic EDP. That procedure would ensure the flaps were up and when hydraulic pressure reached approximately 600 psi; the flap handle would then pop back to the neutral position. With the Left Main Gear compressed; the Squat switch signal to the Hydraulic module should also keep the Anti-Retraction valve closed. After the Left Main collapsed and mechanics lifted the wing; they started pulling the Left gear aft; that's when the Right Gear collapsed. Both Main gears retract forward; not inboard or outboard. The Nose Gear retracts aft. If the single Engine Driven hydraulic pump fails; an Emergency Hand pump can be used to pump up hydraulic pressure. If that fails; a CO2 bottle will blow the gears down. Plans were to replace the Hydraulic module and ferry the aircraft to their Maintenance Base. Since his incident; another pilot told him about a similar event that had just occurred on that pilot's PA23 aircraft.",,,"Pilot reports that upon cranking the Right Engine for start on a Piper PA23 Aztec; the Left Main Gear collapsed; followed by the Right Main Gear collapsing when mechanics had lifted the left wing.

At the time of the belly landing we had only started the #2 engine and were sitting on the FBO ramp having not moved from our initial parked position. Once we were aware of the problem aircraft I began to deplane so I could offer assistance to the disabled aircraft not knowing their status.

Second; I received calls from the ATC Center operations manager after closing my flight plan stating that I violated my IFR clearance with my unauthorized descent.

Before 1.0 DME I armed the 'nav' mode to follow the flight director which was following FMS instructions.  Both pilots had checked the FMS prior to flight and confirmed correct data for the departure and flight.  At approximately 2000' I armed the autopilot and ATC instructed us to climb to 5000'.  At 1.0 DME; the fligt director commanded a left turn and stopped on 177 degrees for a few seconds; as it was supposed to.  The flight director then initiated a turn toward MUSEL.  The autopilot remained on.  At approximately 4000' ATC inquired if we were on the MUSEL 7 departure. We said 'Yes.'  They instructed that we were supposed to remain on 177 degrees and wait for them to vector us.  ATC gave us a new heading; and we complied.    While the FMS initially displayed the correct departure procedure. the flight director initiated  a left turn to MUSEL prior to the point desired by ATC.

I believe there was 8;400 lbs. of fuel on board the aircraft on the ramp. This was 3;000 lbs. over our Takeoff Fuel. The flight was filed to fly at an altitude of FL320 and was restricted by MEL to 250 knots indicated. We received a reroute from ATC when calling for our clearance. I called the dispatcher to inform them of the reroute; and clarified that the fuel performance had been calculated for an aircraft with the gear down the whole flight. The dispatcher ran the new fuel burn for the re-route with me on the phone; gave us a new takeoff fuel load about 10 lbs. higher than our old one. We made Amend 1 for the reroute and new fuel burn. The First Officer (FO) and I felt comfortable with this fuel load; since we knew the dispatcher had planned it for the gear down and we had about 3;000 extra pounds of fuel. We then de-iced the aircraft and headed on our way. During our climb it became apparent that we would not have the performance to reach the planned altitude of FL320. At about FL200 and up; we were climbing at 500 feet a minute and slowly loosing airspeed. Our airspeed never went below 220KIAS. We elected to stop the climb at FL240 and requested that altitude with ATC. ATC assigned us FL240 and we continued to cruise at that altitude at approximately 240-250KIAS. Our thrust was close to max cruise thrust; as this is what was required to maintain our airspeed. We were burning approximately 1;650 LBS per hour on each engine. By the time we were abeam BOS it became apparent that we were burning more fuel than had been planned. We were burning about 3;400 lbs. an hour; had approximately 6200 lbs. of fuel left on board; and about 1 hour and 50 minutes time remaining in the flight. At this point we began messaging our dispatcher that we would most likely need to divert to another airport; as we were not going to have the fuel to make it to ORF and land there with any sort of reserve. The dispatcher was initially hesitant to comply with our request for an alternate airport. We were not in an emergency fuel situation; and had about two hours of fuel left; so we agreed with the dispatcher to check the fuel again in 100 NM and make a decision then. In the interim the crew began planning for a possible diversion. Our route of flight was taking us close to the normal northeast arrival path for PHL. We looked at possible routing and calculated potential fuel burn to PHL. At that point we were flying direct EMJAY or ZIZZI. Both fixes were very close to BRIGS and the JIIMS2 into PHL. We were also at FL240; the altitude at which aircraft begin that arrival. The crew was fairly confident that if we did go to PHL; we would be given this arrival. Approximately 75NM after our initial discussion with dispatch we were at approximately 5;000 lbs. of fuel and still burning 3;400 lbs. an hour. We still had over 1 hour and 30 minutes left to ORF. We made the determination we would not be able to get to ORF; and messaged dispatched telling them as such; and asking that they amend our destination to PHL. Dispatch sent us Amend 2 designating PHL as the destination and we informed ATC we were changing our destination to PHL. ATC asked us the reason for the change; and we told them it was due to unplanned fuel burn.  We were cleared to PHL via radar vectors to BRIGS and the JIIMS2 arrival. About 20NM from BRIGS we determined that upon landing at PHL we would be right at our required alternate burn; and that we had just over an hour of fuel on board; given our current burn of 3;400-3;600 lbs. an hour. We had about 4;000 LBS of fuel on board at that time. We informed ATC that we were 'minimum fuel' at that point. ATC asked how much fuel in minutes was on board; and we came up with a conservative estimate of 60 minutes.  We proceeded to fly the arrival and land on Runway 26 in PHL without incident. We landed with approximately 2;300 lbs. of fuel on board.  On the next segment of flight PHL to ORF I called the dispatcher to discuss the fuel load. The planned cruising altitude for that flight was an 16;000. The planned Ramp Fuel was around 5400 lbs. I felt that this fuel load was not sufficient for a 50 minute flight with the gear down; taking our recent experience into consideration. I requested 9;000 LBS of fuel and the dispatcher agreed and created a new dispatch release with the revised ramp fuel. During that flight we still burned more fuel than was planned on the dispatch release. The planned fuel burn was 1;560 lbs. and we burned approximately 2;600 lbs. during the flight. We landed in ORF without further incident with approximately 6;200 lbs. of fuel. Had the Dispatcher had better information we may never have been planned at FL320. I'm hesitant to believe this alone would have prevented the diversion. I think that the fuel planning software used by our dispatcher inadequately calculated the fuel burn penalty for flight with the gear down. We left the ground 3;000 lbs. of above our Take Off fuel; this should have been enough to get us to our destination and then some. It was frustrating to the crew that the dispatcher needed so much convincing that we were not going to be able to make it to ORF. We tried to communicate our fuel on board; current burn; and time remaining; to show that it was becoming mathematically impossible to get to ORF. Our dispatcher did not seem to believe us at first.",,,,"Flight crew of a CRJ-200 repositioning flight for maintenance were planned for FL320; gear down flight at 250 KIAS.

It was VMC when the failure happened and we were about to descend into an overcast layer around 800 FT MSL without any ground reference. Per ATC Approach instruction; upon going missed we climbed to 2000 FT MSL and flew runway heading with our magnetic compass. We maintained 2000 FT to maintain VFR due to layers above and beneath us. After running through all of the relative checklist with no changes; I decided to fly to an uncontrolled airport to land after exiting the airspace. While performing an emergency gear extension; we regained total electrical power. I determined that the failure was related to the gear switch. After putting the gear down on the approach is when our HSI and NAVs failed. When we went missed and picked the gear up; we lost all electrical power before I could advise Tower of the situation. I attempted to transmit our condition and situation just in case they could hear us. We could not squawk 7600 due to the failure. After lowering the gear for the emergency gear extension and immediately recovering electrical power is when I realized it must be related to an electrical issue with the gear switch. After regaining power I contacted ATC approach on 121.1 and let them know what happened.

When he did that; the gear extended and locked down (three Green lights) and the hydraulic pump stopped; that's when all electrical came back. Maintenance later told him the aircraft battery was weak and would not hold much of an electrical load. As a result; when he had selected 'Up' (retract); the electric hydraulic pump continued to run even with the gear up; until 1400 psi hydraulic pressure has been reached. The PA-44 Landing gears do not have uplocks; continuous hydraulic pressure is used to keep the gears up and locked. With the aircraft battery being weak; even with two Alternators functioning; not enough electrical power was available and the electrical system shut-down until the hydraulic pump no longer was required to keep running to maintain 1400 psi pressure.

I checked the weather; winds varied between calm and 100. Using ForeFlight; I selected the procedure 'Cross-midfield; Teardrop' for Runway 10. I wrote down the UNICOM and pattern altitude for ZZZ1 (122.8 and 2000 FT respectively). I departed ZZZ on Runway 13; in route to ZZZ1. At 3;000 FT MSL I called ZZZ1 UNICOM to announce that I was 7 miles southeast of the field inbound for Runway 10 and would be crossing mid-field at 3;000 FT.I called UNICOM a 2nd time stating that I was 4 miles southeast of the field; inbound for Runway 10 and would be crossing mid-field at 3;000 FT for a tear-drop into the left down-wind for Runway 10. At 3;000 FT I called UNICOM a third time to announce that I was directly south of the field at 3000 FT turning to cross midfield. 4th call to UNICOM: When I was about to cross the airfield I announced that I was crossing midfield at 3;000 FT. Within seconds of my call a parachute jumper dropped in my view at about the 11 o'clock position and approximately 1;000 feet away. He was wearing a red jumpsuit and using a red and white parachute. We made eye contact. I banked to the right and flew northeast out of the airport vicinity. I called UNICOM for a traffic advisory concerning jumpers in the area. Mr. X; at ZZZ1 FBO; called back and said no jumpers are being reported at that time. I told him one just jumped right in front of me --- midfield at 3;000 FT. A 2-minute warning was called out over UNICOM instructing that jumpers were in the area and to not fly over the airport. I stayed northeast of the field at 3;000 FT for quite a while. I called out to Mr. X to get advice as to whether I should return to ZZZ. He said I could go ahead and land when the area was clear. I called UNICOM specifically asking traffic in the area to state their position. They said they were on Final. I stayed in the northeast area at 3;000 FT. I called UNICOM again asking traffic to state their position. They said they were on the ground.  I proceeded into the downwind for Runway 10 on a 45 and landed without incident. After tying my plane down and speaking with Mr. X at the FBO about the near-miss I drove over to the Sky Diving School. I spoke with 3 instructors leaving the building. They denied that there had been a near-miss. But; if it had happened it was because my radios were faulty - or I had stepped on the Sky Diving pilot's transmission when he gave the 2 minute warning - or my calls to UNICOM were stepped on. Regardless; the pilot was an airline pilot and with lots of experience. I went inside to find the owner or manager. [The manager] behind the desk was very helpful and made several calls to find out what happened. She called the owner; he did not speak to me and told [her] that there was not a near-miss; saying that he had been on the radio and heard the 2 minute warning call. After several calls [she] confirmed that the jumper involved in the near-miss was a new instructor. She called and talked to him for quite a while. I could only hear her side of the conversation. He told her they had done a Hop N' Pop where they let out one diver out at a low altitude of 5;000 FT before release the other divers at a higher altitude. She directly asked him if he had almost gotten hit by a plane. I got the impression that he said 'No.' After several more questions she relayed to me that he did remember seeing me but I was already on the ground and he was at 200 FT. [The manager] called [the owner] back to tell him what she had learned. [The owner] asked to speak to me. He said there had not been a near-miss and that the 2 minute warning was given and that there was nothing else to discuss. I called the FAA Center and reported the Near-Miss. What I believe caused the problem:1. After the incident I reviewed the Airport Directory and it states 'avoid over flights of airport. I should have gone around the airport and entered the downwind of Runway 10 on a 45. 2. The airport is identified on the Sectional as ZZZ1 but is also referred to as ZZZ1 X. I used both names in my transmission but this could have been confusing to the other pilot. I will confirm with the local FBO the preferred call name to use. 3. I believe that the Skydiving Pilot did not call out the 2 minute warning for the diver/ instructor on the Hop N' Pop.4. The diver was released 2;000 FT above me and had little time to react.5. I fly a high wing with limited visibility above me and didn't see the parachute until he was directly in front of me. I will need to get advice from my instructor on what to do different in the future.",,,,"The pilot of a C172 was surprised to observe a skydiver falling nearby as he crossed over a non-towered airport.

Prior to departing I contacted Atlantic City Clearance to arrange for flight following. I was given a discrete transponder code and instructions to remain clear of Class C Atlantic City Airspace. I departed remaining clear of the Charlie airspace and contacted Atlantic City Approach. We established communications and confirmed my intentions. En-route somewhere near intersection Panze I received a traffic warning from ATC. I replied as 'Looking'. Afterwards and even though I did not believe the traffic to be an issue any longer; I contacted approach saying 'No Joy on the traffic'. Typically I get a reply to that but this time I did not. Since the controller was busy; I dismissed it as just that; too busy to answer and no factor anyway. The flight progressed and at approximately 10 miles south of my next waypoint Ziggi; I thought I should have received a handoff to Maguire approach by now or at least very soon. I called Atlantic City Approach. No answer at all but they were still busy. So after a minute or two I called again. This time I got a response; 'Aircraft calling Atlantic City Standby and remain clear of Class Charlie'. At this point I realized that I was way into Maguire Approach's radar coverage and still squawking the original discrete transponder code. Since I did not get an answer from Atlantic City and now was approaching my final destination; I reset my transponder to 1200. I listened to Atlantic City Approach for another 5 minutes and never received a call back from my last instruction to standby. I then tuned in to the CTAF for Old Bridge and proceeded with my approach and landed. This upset me as I am a careful and courteous pilot. I have been flying for many years and while I realize I could have missed a call from Atlantic City; I [am] very certain that a handoff or termination of services was never given. Rather I got the sense that I was forgotten; and then unfortunately ignored. The thought of this as a possibility actually sickened me. We all make mistakes and they can be dealt with. Ignoring them is certainly not the answer. I understand that the weather was perfect but that should not matter. Once agreeing to provide the service; that must be what is done or terminate the service. In reviewing my own performance; I should have called Maguire approach and asked if I had ever handed off to them. If not; then I could have at least apologized for the transponder code. Probably because my ground speed on the return legs was 140 MPH; a whole lot faster than normal and it was all happening so quickly; I did not think of that. I worry that this might happen in poor weather conditions where I might have truly needed the assistance. In those conditions and even in good conditions I will be more persistent for an answer and if it were my mistake; I would accept that. I will also speak to an instructor to see how I would have handled this better so that if it should happen again I will be better prepared to deal with it.",,,,"Cessna 172 pilot is under flight following and never gets handed off to the next facility due to traffic and frequency congestion.

The complaint stated by the flight attendant was of an electrical smoke smell. A few other flight attendants also complained of this smell. The captain engaged the autopilot and we transferred the flight controls to me. She then got on the interphone and started talking to the flight attendants. After a few moments we started smelling the same electrical smoke smell. The Captain and the IRO put on their oxygen masks and the IRO started running the smoke/fumes/and odor checklist. I then put on my mask and we continued to run the checklist while I started the process of returning to the airport. My mask microphone after testing fine on the ground did not work in flight which made communication between myself and the rest of the crew difficult. We decided to return to the departure airport.

Crash fire rescue met the aircraft on landing and determined there was no smoke visible from the outside. No evacuation was conducted.We encountered two problems during the event. The first was that there was great difficulty communicating using the mask. The first officer could not hear despite the fact that he had his comm panel set up correctly. I could hear the flight interphone and service interphone but it was very low. As a result I had to use the speaker to communicate on both flight and service interphone. The other issue was that we were not able to get landing data from dispatch. The IRO checked the performance data in the FM.",,"B767 flight crew is informed by the Purser shortly after takeoff that electrical fumes are in the forward galley area and possibly coming from the IFE equipment.

When I got up from my rest break; the Captain informed me that the Chinese controller got excited and said our altitude was off by 100 feet and issued a directive to turn immediately to avoid traffic. Captain said conversion chart he was using came from the ICAO conversion chart. Several questions come to my mind concerning this incident. First; and foremost; why is there a difference between the ICAO chart and our FOM conversion chart? Second; why did the Chinese controller get excited over a 100 feet altitude difference when we have 1000 feet of separation in RVSM airspace?

There were some light green returns on the radar on our right side but no different than returns we had seen for the last 100 or so miles while getting a good ride. We were about 30 NM north of the OMN VOR and started to get moderate turbulence; then got an updraft which pushed us up about 200 feet followed by a significant downdraft which caused us to lose 700 feet. The aircraft was on autopilot the entire time and the FMA showed ALT CRUISE. We got a burst or two of moderate rain which caused significant radio static which is a common problem in the Airbus. I could barely hear the controller say to maintain FL300 to which I replied that we were in moderate and greater turbulence. She responded to return to FL300 as soon as possible. There was no traffic showing on the TCAS at the time. The altitude loss was probably a duration of one minute or so from the time the downdraft began until we were back at FL300.I can only guess that a rapidly growing cell was below us. The new radar in the advanced airbuses does seem to sometimes paint WX less severe than the older radars when in the calibrated position. We were in an area with a lot of other aircraft on basically the same route and no one was deviating or reporting significant turbulence.There were no injuries. I would call the turbulence moderate to severe. The jolts were moderate but downdraft was similar to a mountain wave in that the aircraft could not overpower it but the ride during the altitude loss was not terribly violent.Although not a causative factor in this incident; the airbus radio static problem should be looked into. Whenever you are in cold precipitation it is sometimes impossible to communicate due to the static. I have never experienced that to this degree in 23;000 hours in many types of aircraft. I can only conclude it's a design flaw.",,"A321 Flight crew experiences moderate to severe turbulence at FL300 causing a 700 foot altitude loss with the autopilot and autothrust engaged.

The plane was to be repositioned for the morning revenue flight. On departure; during the climb we began to hear a loud squealing/humming noise.  Sometimes we hear a noise momentarily as the seals set on the door during cabin pressurization.  This time; however; the noise was a little louder than normal and we began to discuss the issue.  On our contact with Center we requested to level at FL180 to troubleshoot the problem.  ATC continued our climb to FL180.  During climb at approximately 15;300; we got a loud howling noise and then a pop.  Captain (CA) immediately told center we needed to descend.  Center gave us pilot discretion to 11;000 and asked if we needed lower. We told him we would advise. CA donned O2 mask and First Officer (FO) followed.  We established communication between each other began a descent.  CA called for Emergency Descent Procedure.  We were quickly at a safe altitude where we could stow the masks.  We declared the Emergency with ATC due to possible structural failure and advised of a possible pressurization issue.  Cabin pressure did not appear to rapidly climb and no loss of pressurization was observed on EICAS after we reached a safe altitude.  We advised ATC we would need delay vectors to get set up for the approach.  We landed on the ILS in VFR conditions.  No emergency equipment was positioned ready upon arrival.  Clearing the runway; we advised ATC that we no longer required assistance.  ATC seemed to be caught off guard by that statement.  It appears that there was a breakdown of communication between the approach controller who received the Emergency advisory from ATC and the Tower Controller.

Movement of the control yoke was not correct as the control wheel would not return to a neutral position. In other words; with full right or left aileron input the yoke would remain in that position without returning to center position being very difficult to move.  Returned to the gate and entered the information into the log book. Maintenance worked on the issue for some time.  Maintenance said that they had found some corrosion around a cannon plug that was giving info to the FCC (I believe that is what they said.) In any case; the airplane passed all the checks and was returned to service. The airplane worked well before takeoff and during all phases until the landing phase when the autopilot was turned off. The First Officer and I had discussed the situation and decided it would be a good idea to shut off the autopilot and make sure all was well. After the autopilot went to dual land the First Officer turned off the autopilot and quickly realized we were again having the same issue with poor aileron movement. I took the airplane and tested the controls. The ailerons were not responding well. We declared an emergency.  I added about 15 knots of speed and they worked better. Ref was 156 knots which put the speed about 170 knots. We briefly discussed a G/A and decided the airplane was stable and in a good position to make a safe landing. Aileron movement was very restricted.  The First Officer did an outstanding job of flying a stable approach and because of this and the lack of crosswinds we were in a good position to continue to a safe landing.  We were asked if we still needed assistance after landing; we declined and went to the gate where we wrote up the problem as well as briefed maintenance. The ailerons reacted as though we were fighting against the auto pilot.","Although nothing definite has been found; the supposition at this time is that water got into some greased bearings and froze in cruise causing the ailerons to become stiff. A long discussion was had with the Maintenance staff before releasing the aircraft to their care and the ailerons became less stiff as time passed. How the crew that flew the aircraft previously missed the stiff ailerons during landing is unknown but an autoland is a possibility.",,,"MD11 Captain reports discovering very stiff ailerons during the control check and returns to the gate for maintenance.

We completed the start sequence and I informed the push back crew we had a problem and asked them to hold on. During this exchange I could barely hear the tug driver due to excessive engine noise. I asked him to position the Mic closer to his mouth. At this point we turned our attention to the Jam light. We contacted maintenance and following their trouble shooting procedures (cycling Jam switch on/off while moving controls) we were successful in fixing the problem. Jam light extinguished. We were now ready to Taxi. I turned the Taxi light on; scanned my side of the airplane announcing it clear; released the parking brake; and began to apply power. I immediately heard the ground crew calling me on the intercom. I quickly stopped what I was doing. I do not think the airplane moved thanks to the quick response by the tug crew. The tug was not connected. I asked the driver if everything was ok and he said yes. The tug crew then cleared off on my side and we continued our taxi. I forgot I requested the tug crew to remain in place while we addressed our problem. I believe this can be prevented by creating a reminder (e.g. a cup; twist tie; etc.) on the throttles. Since keeping a tug crew in place is not the normal habit pattern better briefing between aircrew would have focused greater attention on the fact the pushback crew was still in front of the aircraft.",,,,"A300 Captain experiences a maintenance issue during pushback and asks the pushback crew to standby.

We had performed three approaches at two different airports and we're returning to our home airport to perform the RNAV XY approach. We had been cleared VFR direct to ZZZZz Intersection; at or below 2700 by Approach. We were in level flight at about 2;600 MSL; 7-8 NM Southwest of Airport; when suddenly; without warning; the plane started vibrating violently. [The instructor] immediately grabbed the controls and I released them stating 'you have the plane'. [He] being the much more experienced pilot we both believed; without discussion; this was appropriate. [He] executed a 180 degree turn to the left intending to return to ZZZ. He immediately notified ATC and declared an emergency and Squawked 7700 on the transponder. By this time copious amounts of smoke and oil were spewing from engine cowling and we became concerned about a fire. [He] quickly decided that we were unlikely to be able to make it back to ZZZ with a 10-20 KNT head wind; and with a potential fire; getting on the ground quickly seemed our best choice. He stated his intentions and I fully agreed. We both started looking for a suitable landing site; which we quickly identified; and [he] executed a rapid descent. As we approached the selected field we noticed high power lines on the final approach path and [he] maneuvered to descend below them; which we did. As we passed below the wires there was an audible 'Bang' but the flight path of the plane was unaltered. We continued on final approach and [he] executed a perfect soft field landing in a tilled; frozen; cornfield. There were no injuries. We both unbuckled our seatbelts and exited the plane quickly and walked away. There was no fire and the plane remained upright on its landing gear. Upon Landing we contacted 911; and the FAA. We visually inspected the plane after landing and noticed damage to the plastic wing tip fairing of the right wing. There was no observable damage to any other surface of the plane including the Tail. Later that day we participated in an inspection of the plane and the landing site with an FAA Aviation Safety Inspector; and his team. They determined that it was best to wait until the plane was recovered to a hangar to remove the cowling and inspect the engine compartment. So we have no in sight as to the cause of the engine failure at this time. We returned to Airport ZZZ FBO and were interviewed by the inspection team. We were not informed that there were any violations or discrepancies at the time of this interview.",,"Serving as a flight instructor performing an instrument training flight combined with an IPC (Instrument Proficiency Check). I immediately turned to ZZZ the nearest airport but realized instantly that I did not have enough altitude to make the airport. I then flew to the southeast to the only area that had suitable landing sites. By now smoke was pouring out from under the engine cowling and a film of oil had coated my side of the windscreen. On final we both noticed high tension power lines at our altitude in front of us. I did not believe I could clear the wires over the top as the engine was not making power. This left only one option which was to go under the high tension wires. I wanted to get on the ground as soon as possible as I was concerned of an engine fire. Landing was uneventful save for some minor damage to the right wingtip for reason I cannot explain. I had informed TRACON that I was declaring an emergency. I think there was some confusion as to who was declaring the emergency so I read back my tail number and told ATC that I would squawk 7700 which I did. The ELT went off during rollout. There were no injuries to client and myself.",,"A pilot and instructor in a C172 experienced an engine failure that resulted in an off field landing.",

We had a small amount of clear ice from the descent. I entered the downwind; and when I did the before landing checklist; I put the gear handle down; and the handle illuminated red; we also had no green lights. I stayed at pattern altitude; and began circling the airport to troubleshoot the gear issue. To make sure the indication of the red handle was correct; I did several things. I pulled the power levers back to a point at which the gear horn should sound; I put the flaps past approach; and I turned on the landing lights (which will give you an annunciator). All of which told me the gear was not down.I had seven passengers on board; all of which are Part 135 pilots. The passenger in the co-pilots seat was a Lear first officer. I decided to use him as a cockpit resource; and used CRM. I called for the Emergency Gear Extension Checklist; he pulled out the checklist; and we performed it. With him reading it; and I did the actions. We accomplished the checklist and still had the red handle light. So; I gave him the controls; and we continued to circle the airport. While he was flying; I read the checklist; and ensured proper completion of the items. We continued circling; and troubleshooting the issue.Since the checklist had not worked; I decided to clean up the airplane; and execute the Emergency Gear Extension Checklist again; to double check we had done it properly. At this time I took the controls back; and decided to divert to [a nearby towered airport that had] fire and rescue. En route we accomplished the checklist again; and still had the red light in the handle. When I would try to use the manual gear pump; there was no resistance. The other pilot tried pumping it; and had no resistance. At this time one of the passengers from the back came up front to try to assist; he is a Part 135 Citation Captain; he read the placard near the manual gear handle; and tried pumping it also. He had no resistance on the pump.I did two low passes over runway 17L; so the tower could look at the gear for us; they told us the gear was up. We were low on fuel at this point; and I did not want to risk a flameout. After the second pass; tower cleared me for a visual approach to land on 17R. I briefed the approach to my passenger in the co-pilots seat. I told him we were going to do a gear up landing; and that I would be feathering the props when we have ensured we are going to make the runway; and that when he sees that both props are feathering to pull both of the condition levers to cut off. So that the engines would not be running when we landed. At approximately 100 AGL; we had the runway made; I feathered the props; and he pulled the condition levers. We touched down centerline on runway 17R; we slid; and stayed centerline until we had almost stopped. Then the plane slid a little left of centerline; but stayed in the center of the runway. We evacuated the airplane as soon as we stopped. This happened last night; today maintenance explained to me that I had not properly turned the manual gear release handle.

I began the flight as usual with a preflight and a ground check before taking off. I flew with my first student direct and did three practice approaches before landing. The flight down went without any abnormalities. During the flight all engine instruments were in the green arc.On the ground after landing we ran through the Shutdown checklist. When we moved the mixture to idle cutoff; the engine did not completely shut down. The engine ran very rough and was obviously still getting enough fuel to keep it from shutting down but not enough to create any power. I then shut the engine off by turning off the magnetos. My thoughts were that the mixture cable needed to be readjusted because idle cutoff was not completely cutting off fuel to the cylinders. As we started up the engine for the remainder of the flight with the second student; the engine started normally and the ground check was normal. We took off and did three practice approaches at that airport before returning to our home base. During the return flight all engine instruments were in the green arc and the engine ran normally.We landed without incident; but when we ran the Shut Down checklist; idle cutoff gave us no noticeable difference in power change and the engine still ran like I had not changed the mixture setting at all. I did not want any fuel to be left in the cylinders after I shut the engine down; so I turned off the fuel selector to shut down the engine. I then notified maintenance through dispatch of our squawk. Later; I learned that the mixture cable did not just need to be readjusted but it had broken. I am very aware of how serious the issue could have become.I believe that several human factors could have played a role to why I chose not to stop at the out station and report the issue. The night before; I had only slept for about three hours because my schedule began at a much earlier time than it normally does. I was working a sixth day and with the combination may have been suffering fatigue. I believe I also had a hazardous attitude of invulnerability in which I thought I knew what the problem was and didn't think anything bad could happen because of it. The combination of these factors led to poor decision making.To prevent something like this from happening again; I plan to pay very close attention to the amount of sleep I get each night before flying so that I can be sure to have an alert mind. I also plan to always contact our dispatch so that I can speak with maintenance about any abnormality or issue before continuing any flight no matter how minor I may think it is at the time.",,,,"After the engine did not shut down with the Mixture OFF on two occasions; Maintenance determined the Mixture cable failed and did not control the engine.",

After I established radar identification I continued to work other aircraft and noticed that Aircraft X was not in a right turn on the departure procedure as expected. I questioned the aircraft and was told that they were assigned a vector and to expect additional vectors to Palay intersection. The aircraft was climbing thru 3200 in a 4400 MVA and was headed to the mountain range. I immediately turned the aircraft left on a heading that would take the aircraft to a lower MVA and allow me to vector back on course. A right turn would have the aircraft along the mountains longer before diverging; while a left turn would take the aircraft away from the higher terrain and toward the pineapple fields south of Haleiwa. When the aircraft was headed in the correct direction I instructed the aircraft; 'leaving 4400 (MVA) fly heading 160 vector for.The controller responsible for issuing the departure clearance had apparently issued a radar vector departure clearance. We were not previously aware of this and would not have known other than to observe the aircraft. Because this airport (HHI) is basically non-radar until around 1000 ft. and because of the high terrain and MVA; the aircraft are always assigned a SID. I believe the inexperience of the issuing controller combined with the principal navaid (CKH) being OTS for the normal SID; combined for the non-issuance of a SID.A HCF Center sector issues the clearances when the tower is open. The aircraft always depart on a SID into TRACONS airspace; before transitioning into center airspace.

Aircraft X was an overflight on V386.PSP landing TUS. On V386 this route is head on with the PSP departures from So Cal approach PSP/Desert sector. In the LOA we give these V386 a/c to So cal at 110. When this happens with a PSP departure head on we have to call So Cal and give a restriction to cross Yucca at or above 120. We can also tell So Cal to stop the departure at 100 but there is a MOCA there that they have to climb above it by a certain time and in case of radio failure the best option is to give a restriction. They were flashing an Aircraft Y out of 60 climbing to 130. I called So Cal Springs sector and they would not answer; finally after the third call she answers and yells and says 'Unable I'm busy' without letting me tell her the control instruction; so on the shout line I tell her 'Aircraft Y cross Yucca at or above 120 if not unable handoff;' and I give my initials'. Not knowing if she was going to issue the restriction because I got no response from her. I turn my Aircraft X which was requesting direct BLH; but because of restricted airspace R2501 I couldn't give him direct BLH yet. So he wouldn't be head on with the departure I turn him the only way I can; 15 left. I cannot go right cause of the MVA's; and I can't go further left then 15 degrees because of R2501. If he did not make the restriction it would have still been close; but in my mind at least they weren't head on; and it could have been a crash. She then yelled over the land line handoff; and I replied 'I tried giving you a restriction; but you hung up on me.' I told her; 'Unable handoff'. 'She said he was out of 120'. Looking at the tapes he was at YUCCA at 115. He missed the restriction; so I am not sure if she gave him the control instruction or not. She was very unprofessional. I said okay then point out Aircraft X at 110 will be direct BLH. I took the handoff on Aircraft Y; and she did not answer me again. So I had to punish the pilot and go back to PSP instead of BLH because she was not taking my call on the point out Aircraft X once he cleared R2501. She then was not taking the handoff on him either until finally the controller relieving me called and said 'Handoff Aircraft X'. Then she took the handoff. This was a very unprofessional situation. She should have had an assistant helping her or acted more professional. I needed for her to do the control instruction; and she was not answering. This kind of behavior should not be allowed and punishes pilots and it makes it a hostile work environment. It should definitely be addressed to her. Since she is famous for this kind of behavior; but from what I've heard no one addresses her because of fear.

We asked the Controller to clarify our runway and their runway assignment and they sounded confused but started to move back toward 28L. Since they were on top of us we couldn't go around.

During this portion of the flight the right transponder was in use.As the pilot monitoring; I referenced a shirt-pocket meters conversion chart that had been issued to me while in training. Both the pilot flying and the relief pilot referenced the iPad Tables/Code section of the FOM on page 16.10.10. My shirt pocket reference chart indicated a conversion which resulted in me setting FL29;100. I was advised by both of the other pilots that this conversion was incorrect. They both showed that the correct conversion for this meters to flight level altitude should be FL29;200. Seeing that their reference material was a more current reference; I set FL29;200 in the altitude alert window and we climbed up to FL29;200.Once level at this altitude; ATC queried us about our altitude. They advised us that we were above the assigned altitude of 8;900 meters. They asked us if we were at FL291 and we advised them we were at FL292. They issued an immediate descent to us and a 45 degree right turn off course to avoid converging traffic. Later in the flight we determined that the right transponder was showing the aircraft altitude to be 100 feet higher than the altitude being reported by the left transponder. This was written up in the logbook and maintenance was advised.After being able to review the situation I believe we have two separate issues that caused this controller to believe we had a potential loss of separation in RVSM airspace. They are: 1. Pilots using the FOM conversion table to convert meters to Flight Levels. This resulted in the aircraft being 100 feet higher in altitude than it would be if we used the altitudes on the enroute chart; and 2. The fact that; unknown to us at the time; the right transponder was reporting 100 feet higher than the left transponder which gave the controller the impression that we were a total of 200 feet high in altitude.I suggest that the training center reinforce the correct reference for obtaining the meters to feet altitude conversion is the enroute chart and NOT the FOM tables/codes conversion chart. I also suggest that a meters to FL conversion chart be put into the FOM rather than having to rely on old and possibly outdated training material hand outs. A secondary issue is that the FOM meters conversion table FOM 16.10.10 is not pilot friendly. The single chart is broken into two pages and this is VERY confusing during a time critical analysis of an inflight situation because it appears that data is missing from what a person might assume is a single chart.",,"[ATC] then directed a HDG change of 90 degrees to 180 and a descent to 29200 feet/8900 meters.",,"Confusion between two different flight level/meter conversion tables and a small error in the altitude reporting of the transponder resulted in a small altitude deviation and a corrective clearance from ATC for the flight crew of a B747.",

I understood that the aircraft had just come out of heavy maintenance. Taxied to [runway.] Immediately during takeoff; got unusual vibration; felt in seat and noted on control yoke. Considered rejecting; but felt it would lessen during takeoff roll. Vibration remained until liftoff; ceased once airborne. Called for LNAV at 400 feet AFL; began to notice odor. Odor got stronger; could not identify it; called for CLB THRUST/VNAV at 1000 feet AFL and AUTOPILOT LEFT COMMAND. Asked FO if he noticed odor; he replied he did.  We were focusing on getting the flaps up and were very concerned with the odor when I noticed that the airplane had continued turning left and was not staying on the departure routing. As I began to take corrective action; departure control asked us our heading and told us to turn right to 330 degrees. I disengaged the autopilot; called for HEADING 330; and turned to the right. After passing about 300 degrees; departure told us to turn left to 270. After stabilized in the climb and on heading; I called for autopilot on again. We were then cleared direct to a fix on the departure; engaged LNAV and continued with the departure. We discussed the unknown odor; decided that one of us should go on oxygen. I transferred flying duties to the FO and donned the oxygen mask. The fumes; which began after gear retraction; seemed to be decreasing in intensity; and we agreed they smelled like hot rubber. Since the fumes were seemingly decreasing; we agreed to continue the flight; referring to the QRH for guidance. Not knowing the source of the fumes; we thought there was a possibility we may have had a tire failure due to the vibration during takeoff roll; followed by the rubber-like fumes after airborne. There were no abnormal indications on any aircraft systems. I assumed flying duties after level off at cruise altitude. Not knowing for sure if we had a tire problem or not; we elected to have the arrival tower roll the equipment out for our landing; which was uneventful. After parking at the gate; we were told by maintenance personnel that new brake pads were a known source of the odor as we described it.Neither the FO nor I understand why the airplane did not remain in LNAV and fly the departure routing. As the flying pilot; I may have bumped the HEADING SELECT button when I rotated the heading know after our initial left turn on the departure. Even with our focus on our other issues; it did not take long for us to notice that we were not on the departure routing and begin to intervene when departure called and gave us a heading back to the left. Obviously; we were distracted by the odor and would have noticed going off the departure much sooner than we did.As always; fly the airplane first; ensuring that it stays on the desired course.

Ended up three hours delayed due to not having an alternate on our release when we required it; thus not having fuel for the alternate. Ended up 2+ hours delayed due to waiting for fuel and unloading bags after passengers decided to deboard and then pretty much starting from the beginning paperwork wise. Ended up departing finally. Takeoff was normal; noted on climb aircraft required slightly more than normal left rudder trim when I looked at how coordinated the aircraft was flying. Added trim to center the 'ball'; engaged AP and away we went on the flight. Ended up doing an ILS app into our destination thus did not land the aircraft due to it being a CA approach so I was not able to feel what the aircraft felt like when landing. Landed and again; repeated the MEL procedure before departing. Before our first departure noted the Rudder Trim was 1/2 deflected when trimmed during climb and cruise. During descent; we noted aircraft required even more trim to have the ball centered; up to 3/4 of total trim being used to fly coordinated. Noted indicator was working properly if we were able to fly coordinated by applying the correct amount of trim in and in what the normal direction would be if it had been operative. After landing on the next leg; we took all trim out to neutral while taxing and the aircraft pulled to one side.Looking back at the situation; if I had seen how much rudder trim was in; I could've noted something didn't added up. Also; we then noted that in cruise and in the descent into ZZZ; when the aircraft had been trimmed out to perfectly centered; the rudder pedals too were displaced correctly thus verifying that the Yaw trim indication was correct if what showed matched with what the rudders were doing. When we arrived at the gate; I discussed with the CA if that MEL was correct since the indicator seemed to work but the aircraft was still flying uncoordinated and required huge amounts of trim. After we realized how much trim was needed to fly coordinated; we figured it would be very hard to maintain control of aircraft in the possibility of an engine failure with less rudder available with all that trim set during flight; possibly leading to control issues in that scenario. Called Maintenance to verify MEL and they had agreed that the MEL didn't match up. Aircraft ended up being taken out of service due to not being able to figure out what the main problem could be. The MEL wording for Yaw Trim indication was vague when CA read procedure to me. Didn't specify how exactly to verify Rudder Trim was to be set to neutral. Also; with the delays and the huge mess that morning it could've led to just skimming over the MEL. I could've also checked the can but was task saturated with being on the radio with Ops; Clearance; Dispatch and the communicating with the gate agent about the status of the flight. That A/C can had at least three write ups for the same problem and all the corrective actions said were that a flight control test had been done to correct it. Initially; when brought up to Maintenances' attention; there was a disconnect between us as to why this was such a huge problem until it took us a few attempts to explain why this could be a huge issue. Although it didn't present any flight control issues during our normal flights; engine failures can happen (one happened recently here) and could have turned an Incorrect MEL procedure error into a bigger issue had something worse happened. Many of these MEL issues not corresponding to the correct write up stem from Maintenance trying to find a MEL to attach it to thus solving the problem and getting the aircraft out with minima l delay. Sometimes; not a whole lot of reading is done to ensure the MEL being used agrees with what is trying to beMEL'd. We could use quality control in the Maintenance department. to prevent these issues from happening over and over again. Aircraft looked normal and I did not see any visible damage on the aircraft during my walk around that would suggest that there was some bigger issue with the plane causing it to fly that un-coordinated in flight.",,"[Report narrative contained no additional information].",,"An ERJ-175 rudder trim indication was MELed; but the crew discovered after flying two legs that substantial left trim was needed for coordinated flight.

It had a right hand wing inboard flaperon fairing that had become delaminated and which a section of the flaperon had departed the aircraft. Initially it was attempted to complete a temporary repair on the fairing and fly revenue back to ZZZ and complete permanent repairs at that time. Engineering decided that they would not agree to a revenue flight but would allow one cycle for a maintenance ferry. I had no direct contact with Engineering. Our Maintenance Control Technician X was talking to them through this event.  The decision was made to remove a good fairing from Aircraft X; the inbound Maintenance Base visit aircraft and use it on Aircraft Y to provide a good aircraft for our passengers. Aircraft Z; another B777; was being ferried from ZZZZ1 to ZZZZ for a Return to Revenue Service at this time as well. The crew flying Aircraft Z was slated to take Aircraft X back to ZZZZ1 for its Maintenance check. They had limited crew legality time and due to slot availability needed to get Aircraft X back to ZZZZ1 in a timely fashion.  At this time the temporarily repaired fairing was placed on Aircraft X and it was maintenance ferried to ZZZZ1 At the time this event was occurring there were approximately 150 aircraft out of service. There were two maintenance ferries occurring and the work card management system was not operating so that no work cards could be printed for any maintenance work being performed worldwide. The workcard issue was about to become a major event as nearly every maintenance station required multiple cards to complete the overnight Bills of Work on their aircraft. It would also cause disruption for those European and Asian flights which were preparing to depart.  This kept me and my assistant thoroughly occupied throughout the night. The underlining cause was the sheer volume of work and my inability to give this item the necessary time needed to make the correct decision. My suggestions for avoiding a repeat event such as I have described; would be to make sure that when the workload becomes heavy; the individuals involved need to use the same methodology to make decisions as they would when the workload is light. Important decisions need time and thought to ensure the outcome is safe and legal.",,,,"A Maintenance Controller reports about the sheer volume of work that contributed to a B777 aircraft being dispatched with a known damaged flaperon installed.

Shortly after takeoff the f/a at 1L cross aisle told me he could smell burning acrid smell like plastic and asked me to call cockpit. I couldn't smell it myself so asked him to relay info to cockpit. I got up and went to the cross aisle and along with another f/a checked the galley for obvious signs; ovens. Circuit breakers popping etc. the smell was coming or appeared to be coming from the cross aisle area particularly the vent in the ceiling. Another F/A was relaying the information to the cockpit. We were asked to turn off the entertainment system and cockpit shut down the power to seats and galleys. He informed me that the captain said we were going back to the departure airport. She then made a PA wearing an oxygen mask saying we were going back due to smoke in the cabin. I immediately phoned her to say that there was no smoke; just acrid smell which could now be smelled in Y section of the plane.We landed to be met by fire service. The captain explained to them that the smoke had gone and that the problem had been the entertainment system at 1l jumpseat. I had to relay that there had been no smoke and she said that she had understood that we saw smoke. I didn't mention smoke at all. Also it was the cross aisle not 1l jumpseat. We were surprised that the pilots didn't come to check the smell themselves. The smell was intermittent but sometimes very strong; passengers in 1st class smelled it as well.1. On the ground there was a problem with the lavatories not working on the ground the captain did not want to take the plane and told them she would turn right around if there was a problem with them in the air.2. The captain made an announcement to passengers that we needed to get out quickly because there were strong winds going in to ZZZ and the aircraft would not hold up under those conditions. 3. I (purser) was told we were going back to gate due to the smoke; I clarified there was no smoke just burning smell. I asked if she would let the passengers know which she said yes. We prepared the cabin for landing and while strapped in our seats we heard her announcement to passengers (on oxygen mask which scared people) that we had an emergency landing and that fire trucks would be there but to expect a normal landing.I had not been advised it was any kind of emergency; the 1st we knew was this announcement and we were already in our seats ready to land. We had not prepped the cabin for emergency.4. I think crew resource management needs to be improved; maybe bring back the cabin advisory as we didn't know what was going on.",,"On the ground before boarding; half our lavatories were inop all down the left side; and the mechanics told the captain that they would work once we reach an altitude of 16000 feet. The captain was not happy about taking the plane but said she would turn around and come back if they didn't work in the air.Just before the door closed the Captain made a PA to explain that we were passed the departure time due to the issue with the lavatories. She then stated that there were strong winds expected in our destination so we need to get out early in order to beat them there. She said the winds are going to be strong cross winds across the runways and that this aircraft would struggle to land in such strong winds; in fact any aircraft would struggle to land in crosswinds that strong. After takeoff; I was sitting at ROW (overwing) with my colleague. We were still seated when we noticed that the galley power and chillers suddenly shut off. My coworker went to investigate; she said the FA's at the front could smell an acrid smell coming from the vents so the pilots have turned the power off. I went up there to see if I could help; but I could not smell anything at all. The other FA's said it was an intermittent smell. I went back to business class. Then 10 minutes later; the purser came and told me that we were going back to the departure airport.My coworker and I began to get the cabin ready for landing. She pointed out that as there was no power on the aircraft that we would have to manually put the seats back into landing position. So we worked together and reset about 3 or 4 seats; on our hands and knees as the footrests are hard to get down. One footrest refused to go down so we had to move the passenger.We then sat at our jumpseats; overwing. The captain made a PA saying that 'The FA'S had seen smoke in the cabin and we were going to make an emergency landing back into the departure airport.' She made the announcement whilst wearing her oxygen mask (you can hear it; like diving apparatus). She said that 'We would be met by emergency vehicles on the runway; and we would pull over to the side of the runway for them to check us over. Expect a normal landing. We'll be on the ground in 10 minutes.'We then landed; quite heavily. The captain stated over the PA 'Remain seated; remain seated.' I got up from my jumpseat; walked through the galley and looked into the cabin; but everything was ok; no smoke; [and] no smell. Fire engines came over to where we pulled up and circled us. Then after some minutes we taxied to the gate.We were then given a hotel room for 7 hours and asked to work the later flight. It's only possible to get a couple of hours sleep during the day and then be back on duty again. I did not feel rested enough to be able to work a flight home. Upon landing I would have been awake for 24 hours having only had 2 hours sleep in the hotel.

Flight was scheduled to depart at XA00. The updated schedule shows that we departed at XB18. At the time of boarding; a snow storm entered the area/corridor. This aircraft was then scheduled for and was de-iced. I was seated in the front jumpseat; facing aft; [and] working as Flight Attendant A. We taxied for; what appeared to be; at least 15-20+ minutes or more. It is somewhat difficult for me to determine the exact amount of time because there were numerous questions from passengers regarding arrival; could they use the bathroom; could they turn on their cell phones; etc. Essentially; I was 'busy' with passenger's questions and comfort. However; having flown for years with another Airline; before joining this one; I was somewhat familiar with de-icing. After what was 20+ some minutes (again; I am unsure of the time); I noticed a build-up of snow on the forward First Class Windows on AC Right and AC Left. Once we stopped moving; I took it upon myself to walk aft through the cabin and casually observe the wings. With the exception of perhaps a 4 foot by 4 foot area on the leading edge; the wings were covered with the slushy snow/ice mixture. I walked forward; called to notify the Flight Deck of what I was seeing with respect to the windows and wings. The Captain (or perhaps First Officer) opened the cockpit windows to view the wings and agreed with my observation. The fight was then returned to the gate. The plane was once again de-iced/anti-iced; however; we were then advised that the flight was canceled. The cancellation was due to the crew; who was to have flown the return flight. I was told the crew had called in fatigued. Our current block time reads that we pushed and returned to the gate two hours later. For more exact times; amount of time on taxi; perhaps the Captain's log would be more definitive. Nevertheless; it is this writer's opinion that there was a failure with respect to technique (on behalf of the crew de-icing the AC) or failure with the mixture of the chemicals used; perhaps failure with the de-icing mixture/equipment or failure with respect to ATC to allow an AC to accumulate a snowy/ice mixture on an aircraft presumably ready for takeoff. Respectfully; I would request that this circumstance be investigated; to assure good safety standards are being followed during de-icing. To prevent this occurrence; it would need to be determined the cause of this event. If this was due to operator procedure; equipment failure; improper use of equipment; improper mixture of chemicals for weather; delay on taxi; etc. It is this writer's opinion that this matter should be investigated to determine the reason and then all involved should be re-acquainted with the proper procedures to be followed to prevent this from occurring. I believe that it was a fatal crash which brought us to the need for de-icing/anti-icing. I respectfully request that this occurrence NOT go without notice.",,,,"EMB175 Flight Attendant notes a slushy snow/ice mixture on the aircraft wings as the flight is about to takeoff and informs the Captain.

We briefly reviewed the paperwork with [Lead Mechanic] and he told us the torque was 500 foot pounds. We started with 440 foot pounds but could not get any of the tabs to line up. I think we advance the torque setting to 480 foot pounds one time and could not get any tabs to line up. We then advanced the torque setting to the maximum of 500 foot pounds and still could not get any tabs to line up. We backed off the nut and re-torqued it at least 3-4 more times with an inspector present and were never able to align any of the tabs. We discussed our dilemma with the midnight shift supervisor and he turned over the job to midnight shift Mechanic X. Midnight AMT X reviewed the paperwork and pointed out that the paper read 500 lbf. in. It was obvious to us at that point that we had over torqued the side stay bushing.

I started a descent and switched to the Alternate static source which caused the pilot side altimeter to rise roughly 500 feet from where it was. I continued the flight and queried ATC about what altitude they showed me at to make sure all systems were now in agreement. Additionally with the autopilot on in level flight (no change in altitude by either altimeter); the pilot side VSI was steady at 400 fpm descent and the co-pilot VSI showed a 300 fpm climb. After landing the altimeters were accurate and the pilot side VSI showed a 200 fpm climb and the co-pilot vsi was level. I consulted the lead mechanic from base and he said to put the aircraft in a heated hangar where ice could melt and drain. The subsequent flight showed no irregularity after checking the normal and alternate sources.

I was working the off-shore radar sector Rac82/83 during the day shift. This radar sector manually coordinates with the D88 ATOP controller; feeding the radar traffic to the non-radar controller. Aircraft X had been coordinated down L452; which is parallel to L453; and prior to OXANA; Aircraft X's radar service had been terminated. Alongside Aircraft X; on the parallel airway L453; was Aircraft Y. Both aircraft were at FL370. Aircraft X progressed OXANA at XX00Z. Shortly after that; I noticed Aircraft X's track was proceeding along M325; and not L452. I called Aircraft X in the blind and asked another flight to attempt contact through company channels. In addition; I asked the D88 controller to call Aeronautical Radio and have the flight contact me. On any other sector I would have attempted contact on Guard; but R82/83 has no guard frequency transmitter!  I could have asked one of the other flights to transmit on Guard to contact Aircraft X; but as circumstances worked out; I didn't need to (such a procedure is more time consuming; since you must explain to the assisting flight exactly what you need; and time was of the essence). Aircraft X was proceeding towards ONGOT; which Aircraft Y was also proceeding towards. They had less than one minute converging at ONGOT. Southeast-bound M325 traffic and southbound L453 traffic require fifteen minutes crossing to be separated. The situation was thus: at best; had I taken no action; we had a 93% loss of separation; at worst; a mid-air collision. Aircraft Y; whom I was still in contact with; was south of PAEPR; and rapidly leaving radar airspace.  I issued a heading of 230 to Aircraft Y both to keep the flight in radar and point Aircraft Y at Aircraft X; thus ensuring that they would miss each other. I later turned Aircraft Y further right to heading 240. Aeronautical Radio contacted Aircraft X and told the flight to call me on VHF; which Aircraft X did. Once I had contact with Aircraft X; we determined that their flight plan did not match what was in our Flight Data Entry Printout. I established degrees divergence between Aircraft X and Aircraft Y using vectors; and sent them back onto what we had originally shown their routes to be: L452 and L453. My actions prevented any loss of separation. FLM (Front Line Manager) [name removed] looked into the situation and his preliminary investigation pointed to the tower activating the wrong flight plan; which was entirely identical up until OXANA; so there was no earlier opportunity to discover the discrepancy. FLM [name removed] filed a report. Aircraft X told me they had been issued several code changes; and had ultimately ended up back on their original code. While this is not positive proof of a flight plan discrepancy; it is a common occurrence when there is a flight plan discrepancy. Most disturbing in this situation is that ATOP received a position report from Aircraft X; progressing OXANA; estimating NETSS; and ONGOT next.  This is out of conformance with the L452 routing that ATOP was showing; but ATOP did not issue an out of conformance message. I believe this is due to the ATOP-radar present position report being within the lateral bounds of L452 when the message was sent. In a fully non-radar situation; ATOP will inform the controller if a position report is out of conformance; route-wise; if the present position is outside of parameters; or if the next position is outside of parameters; or if the ensuing waypoint is outside of parameters. Here; because of the ATOP-radar; the ATOP did not report the next position or ensuing waypoint as out of conformance; which they were by a dangerous margin. This is unsafe. Also unsafe is the lack of a Guard transmitter with R82/83.Other possible solutions for avoiding a reoccurrence of this type of dangerous situation: R82/83 controllers being required not to terminate radar north of OXANA or PAEPR (a practice which I have now adopted); Flights issued multiple code changes and are heading into WATRS or Oceanic airspace might be advised to ask for a routing confirmation; coordination between R82/83 and D88 being mandated to be effected at ZZTOP; NETSS; and SAUCR (as opposed to OXANA/PAEPR); which would have caught this error.",,,,"ZWY Controller describes a situation where two aircraft that he was responsible for were on a course to collide.

The pilot stated he was so I issued the climb to 140.  The pilot later stated 140 would be too high for his airplane.  I told him I was unable to allow the IFR clearance due to terrain and suggested a VFR bearing due west to get in terrain that would allow IFR flight at a lower altitude.  The pilot seemed to like the idea and I asked if there was any issue of cloud avoidance with the plan we were executing.  At the appropriate altitude; I was then able to issue an IFR clearance.

Aircraft X eastbound restricted to 10;000 feet with Aircraft Y also eastbound climbing above Aircraft X. The trainee restricted Aircraft X at 10;000 feet; at some point the pilot asked for a block altitude 9000 feet block 10;000 feet; the trainee responded 'I have your request'; it was never approved. The trainee started to fall behind; there was a lot of frequency congestion on multiple frequencies. The amount of traffic and frequency congestion was beyond the trainee's capability so I took the frequencies. Aircraft X was blocked on the frequency at least once but I knew he was restricted below Aircraft Y and I had higher priority transmissions. I heard the controller-in-charge (CIC) ask what Aircraft X was doing; I saw him at 103 and immediately descended him back to 10;000 feet; I gave him the brasher warning. The Pilot stated that I didn't answer him so he decided to climb (paraphrasing). I never saw a loss of separation; the closest altitudes were 10;700 feet and 11;700 feet.Although this was not a result of a phraseology error; I did review 'On request' phraseology with the trainee. I don't believe the pilot was confused about the altitude restriction. The Pilot did not receive a reply from ATC due to frequency congestion and decided to climb. Even if I would have taken control of the position and frequencies sooner; it would not have prevented this situation because I had other higher priorities. I would recommend monthly or quarterly meetings with the squadrons; an exchange of knowledge; rules and restrictions from both sides (pilots and controllers; not office staff or management) would be beneficial.",,"The two aircraft involved in the incident were Aircraft X and Aircraft Y which departed Tucson Int'l.

I noticed the aircraft were climbing at similar rates so Aircraft X was capped at 9;000 feet and Aircraft Y continued to climb. When Aircraft Y reached 10;000 MSL I would put him over the top of Aircraft Y and give him direct El Paso. I tried calling traffic for Aircraft Y on two occasions; but he could not get the aircraft in site. Also going on in the airspace was a guard recovery of multiple aircraft checking in with requests on different frequencies that I was monitoring. There were also different departures checking in at the same time. The frequencies were getting congested as people started stepping on each other. I am only [time removed] training hours into this position and I was starting to get a little overwhelmed. I then noticed that Aircraft Y had left 11;000 feet so I went back and assigned Aircraft X 10;000 feet which was read back correctly by the pilot. At that point Aircraft X requested a block altitude of 11;000 feet to 13;000 feet. My 'response was 'Aircraft X; I have your request'. I went back and talked to other aircraft. A moment later my trainer took over the frequency and told Aircraft X he can not climb on his own and warned of a possible pilot deviation. I looked at the data blocks and Aircraft X had climbed through 10;000 feet and was indicating 10;400 feet while Aircraft Y was still going over the top indicating 11;300 feet. My trainer took over the frequency to catch me up a little bit; and also to warn Aircraft X of a possible pilot deviation; and advise he call the radar facility. I was unsure if there was an actual loss of separation. The Falcon replay looked to show 1;000 feet at all times; but I was told that the there was a loss of separation. The final was 800 feet and 3.84 miles. I feel this was a pilot deviation as Aircraft X was assigned and read back 10;000 feet; a safe altitude that met all upcoming Minimum Vectoring Altitude (MVA); but he decided to climb on his own.As a trainee I learned a lot from this incident especially after a debrief with my trainer; and more discussion with a FLM as I discussed what were some different techniques to act sooner; and get better control of the frequency. The plan I had did ensure separation; but there were different techniques to not even make this a factor had I acted on the conflict sooner. I know there are techniques to such as expediting climbs if able; or stopping one of the aircraft sooner. I am new to radar and am learning a lot; but this was an unfortunate event that I was able to learn a lot from.My original plan to separate the aircraft could have worked; but as a result of this deviation I learned ways to better control the frequency and resolve conflicts closer to the airport as opposed to further out when aircraft are at higher speeds.",,"U90 Approach Controller describes a confusing reply from his trainee to a pilot.

I declared an emergency with ATC and we received vectors to return to the departure airport.  Both Pilots went on O2.  I ran the appropriate QRH checklist to the point that it made more sense to discontinue that and configure the aircraft.  We were cleared for a Visual Approach; landed; and cleared the runway.  I conferred with the FAs; and we had the fire trucks check the aircraft quickly.  They found nothing; so we taxied to the Gate and deplaned all passengers with their belongings.  The logbook write-up detailed that the smell was least to the front of the cabin; and strongest to the middle and aft. The smoke was smelled but was not visible. While the First Officer (FO) was putting on his mask; I caught a faint whiff of something; but my mask was on immediately after that so I had little basis to identify what type of odor it was.  Most reports were of a metallic or electrical type of smell. The FAs performed admirably; keeping the Passengers all calm; and the jumpseat (commuting) FA; was very helpful as well; reassuring nervous Passengers seated near the over wing exits.  The FO did an excellent job flying the aircraft back to final while I worked with the FAs; ATC; and the QRH.  We may have exceeded 250 KIAS below 10;000 feet in the course of expediting the return; in exercise of my emergency authority. The Fire Department was very responsive and I appreciate their excellent work and preparedness to support us.  The Agent who manned the jetway and assisted the deplaned Passengers did great work; and the Mechanics who met the aircraft were very helpful getting everything taken care of as we handed the aircraft off to them.I spoke with our Dispatcher; then the Safety; then the Chief Pilot; and later a Union Representative.  Knowing that 'I feel good now' is no guarantee of feeling good later; my input to the Chief Pilot was that we should not operate the leg; but (after consulting with the FO) that we would be agreeable to deadhead to ZZZ.  Scheduling arranged that we would spend the night and we'll rejoin the trip tomorrow.  All in all; things worked the way one would hope that they would; given the situation we had.  The only negative aspect I see to how everything was handled was that Inflight was spring loaded to have our FAs work the leg.  When you ask the wrong question (are you okay?); you'll get the wrong answer; and their question is couched in exactly the terms that will elicit the 'yes we can continue' response.  The FAs smelled far more smoke than we did and were in the spotlight setting the tone for all of the Passengers; they have no more business being responsible for the safety of the Passengers (two hours later) than we do.

One screen in particular caused an issue; it was the screen marked >7500. I don't recall selecting anything; but somehow Dispatch immediately send an ACARS message asking to call him. So I immediately picked up my cell phone and called. He said he received a hijack message absent any info but the flight number and thought it odd since we're at the gate and had barely started boarding.

While on the phone with the dispatcher; I tested the DNES button by pushing it; oddly enough; he got no message; so I'm not even sure if that function is active yet.I reviewed the ACARS bulletin associated with this update. It states that a 7500 message is auto sent if you leave the page up for 2 minutes. The only other possibility is the send button marked DNES was pushed which happens to be next to the RETURN to menu button. It's hard to figure because it seemed as if I went through those pages fairly quickly. My best guess that I got interrupted just long enough by the boarding agent; maintenance or the flight attendant. I'm sure this will happen more often as pilots begin to encounter the new software. Personally; I think there should be a requirement to manually SEND such a message and/or the SENT (DNES) button (key 5L) is moved away from the RETURN button (key 6L). I can't imagine a situation wherein you can get to this page; yet not have the extra micro second to hit the SEND button. If the threat was that great; I can assure you that you'd never get to that page to start with. It is also confusing as to what 'DNES' stands for.

Never hesitate to speak up when your comfort level has been exceeded.",,"I was the Captain and pilot monitoring  The First Officer (FO) has very low time in the right seat of the 777 and is apparently unused to flying long-haul all-nighters; so it is natural that he was having a little trouble keeping up with the rapidly changing nature of this particular approach  Our runway was changed; 'with our approval'; from 36L to 36R; then in quick succession we were cleared direct to the ZZZ fix; then cleared down to 3;000 feet; then given a right turn to intercept the LOC just outside the ZZZ fix  At this point there was some confusion about whether we had been cleared for the approach; with the FO thinking we were; 'though we were not yet'; and wanting to arm approach mode this resulted in a brief discussion; followed shortly by another one about whether or not he was required to extend the centerline from the FAF.  At about this time; I mentioned that we were getting close to the final approach segment and ought to start slowing and configuring.  During this time we were cleared for the approach; but the FO did not mentally register this so he did not then arm Approach Mode to permit intercepting the glideslope (GS).  This resulted in us remaining at 3;000 feet in altitude hold mode as we passed through the GS.  The Relief Officer (FB) and I were making suggestions to help him; but I now believe we might inadvertently have been distracting him; making it more difficult for him to get his situational awareness back  As a result; we were coming down slowly; still well above the GS; and I could see that at the current rate we would not get down to it before having to go around.  Fortunately; we broke out of the clouds between 1;200 feet and 1;100 feet AGL and were in visual conditions for the rest of the approach and landing; so I realized we had brief window in which to get down to the GS before reaching the required stabilized approach minimum altitude of 500 feet for visual conditions  Otherwise we would have executed a missed approach at 1;000 feet; as is required in IMC.  Therefore I briefly took control of the aircraft; disconnected the autopilot; and established a higher rate of descent for a few seconds to get us back to a position where we could be fully stabilized and on the proper visual descent path by 500 feet.  Then I reconnected the autopilot; armed approach mode; and returned control to the FO.  Immediately after this; the tower called to relay that they were receiving a low altitude alert on us and to check our instruments.  I responded that we were visual.  The FO completed the approach and landing in an excellent manner.We conducted an extensive and very constructive debrief in the cockpit after completing the parking checklist; and we agreed that since no regulations had been violated; and the operation was never unsafe; that a report would not be necessary.  However; I was advised this afternoon that it might be a good idea to file one anyway just in case there were any questions about what had happened; so here it is.  Would I do anything differently if presented with a similar situation? Yes; absolutely  I had been allowing the FO to dig himself a hole so that he could better learn from the experience; but 'though that was very valuable once to me as an FO myself'; I shouldn't expect it to be the best method of learning for everyone.  And anyway; I let the hole get too deep before stepping in and taking control.  In the future; I will be more strongly directive earlier in the situation; take control sooner if necessary; and rely much more on the debrief for teaching.",,"B777 flight crew describes an un-stabilized approach caused in part by fatigue and very low time in the seat by the First Officer and the Captain allowing the First Officer to get a little too far behind before taking over.",

Taking off from MKE; we were cleared on the UECKR 1. Climbing through about 11k; departure cleared us to resume normal speed. On day 1 when the resume normal speed call was made; the first officer (FO) and I had a 'what was that about look' but the frequency and our tasking was busy so I did not inquire as to what the resume normal speed clearance pertained to. I assumed (incorrectly) that departure thought we had been assigned a speed from the previous controller although we had not. We continued on to destination. On day two with a different FO we were cleared on the UECKR1 and again; climbing through about 11k; departure cleared us to resume normal speed. This time I had the second FO inquire as to why this clearance was given. At this time; the controller told us that there was a 250-knot restriction on climb-out until further advised. We then had the '''Oh no; we missed that look''' at each other and said roger. However; we had already began to resume our normal speed since we had failed to see the SID speed restriction in the first place.

I flew again with that FO today and briefed him on what the 'resume normal speed' call was all about and the note that we both missed.

The crew; including the jumpseater; commented that we had no idea where that came from since the air was clear that day and smooth. Then the First Officer (FO) noticed the Left Engine ITT was around 880 and climbing. The FO was the Pilot Flying (PF) so I took the QRH as I reduced the thrust on the left engine to attempt to bring the ITT down (now above 900). Reducing the thrust made no change at all. There was no change in the ITT or any N1 or N2 change; there was also no change in yaw. Up to this point I thought the engine was just overheating; when reducing the thrust made no change I realized the engine had failed. I believe since we were at a relatively low power setting during the descent; there was no noticeable yaw when the engine failed and that's why we didn't realize it was a failure right away. I told the FO to declare an emergency while I ran the QRH. The jumpseater offered to help with anything we needed. The only CAS message was Low Oil Pressure; so I chose to go with the Engine Failure QRH Item. By this time; the ITT had exceeded 999 and changed to '---' but the fuel flow indication was 0 on that engine. When I moved the thrust lever to shutoff as guided by the QRH; the ITT immediately began cooling. I did not expect this since the fuel flow indication was already 0. I continued with the QRH and reached the portion that says 'if severe engine damage is expected' and directs you to restart or continue with a single engine. At this point; the engine ITT had cooled to 70C and there was positive N1 rotation; positive N2 rotation; and positive oil pressure. We had not heard any loud explosions or anything from the engine. We had no idea what caused it to fail. We discussed that it could have possibly been a flameout or a compressor stall and the engine itself was potentially still capable of running. I mentioned that if we attempted a restart and it overtemped again that we could shut off the fuel and would be no worse off than we already were. Additionally; if it caught on fire; we still had the fire PUSH switchlight as well as the fire bottles available to use; so I felt safe attempting a restart. I asked the FO and jumpseater if they agreed or had any other thoughts and they both agreed with me. I attempted a restart of the left engine and was prepared to abort the start if it looked like things were going wrong. The engine seemed to start without issue. There was a vibration during the start that subsided as RPM increased; however; we all seemed to remember feeling a similar vibration when doing an in air restart in the sim. I watched the VIB gauge and it rose to a maximum of 1.7 (within the acceptable range) and decreased as the start progressed. We did not consider this a problem at this time. As the engine neared the normal operating RPM ranges; the ITT was rising at a normal rate as would be expected during a normal start on the ground. However; the ITT never stopped and continued to increase to redline. I shut off the fuel and I think the ITT peaked around 905 during the restart attempt. At this point; the ITT reduced again just as it had the first time and there was no fire indication at any time during this incident. I continued with the QRH for a single engine landing. We were already on the downwind leg of the arrival so we decided to land there. ATC asked us our desired runway and we chose the longest runway. When I had completed the QRH down to the descent checklist; I told the FO and jumpseater that I needed to call the FA and tell the passengers something. Since we didn't know the engine had failed at first; we fully expected that the passengers didn't know. I consulted with the FO and Jump seater on what I should say to the passengers to avoid them becoming unnecessarily alarmed when they sawrescue vehicles on the ground. We agreed to tell them we had a mechanical issue that we wanted rescue vehicles to observe just as a precaution and there was no need to be alarmed. I called the FA using the normal FA call button to avoid her becoming alarmed; as we had plenty of time and were not in a rush. I told her that we had an engine failure and were planning a single engine landing. We did not expect to evacuate and everything was going to be normal except a higher approach speed. At this time I discussed with the FO that I would like to take controls and perform the landing myself. We rebriefed the approach since we had previously prepared prior to the engine failure. We then told approach that we were ready to commence the approach and requested rescue vehicles to be standing by. I performed a completely uneventful landing with no problems at all. We taxied off the runway slowly with rescue vehicles following us. ATC wanted to know when we would like to terminate the emergency. I told them I wanted to have the rescue vehicles take a closer look before we canceled it. We taxied to the west hardstand for closer inspection. I told the passengers that everything was ok and we were just having the rescue vehicles take a closer look outside since we couldn't see outside ourselves. After a few minutes; the rescue personnel gave us the all clear and we continued taxi to the gate. The passengers were grateful for us getting them on the ground safely and were completely unaware that an engine had failed. After passengers had deplaned; maintenance met us at the gate for an unrelated reason and we informed them what had happened. I then contacted the chief pilot; dispatch; and union to make sure all required reports were made. Overall; the crew is completely unaware of what caused the engine to fail and we do not believe we did anything that caused the engine to fail. We were at a moderately low power setting during the failure as we were descending and there were no power changes just prior to the failure.",,"During descent we experienced what the crew can describe as a momentary turbulence. The Captain (CA); First Officer (FO) and the jumpseater all commented on the situation and none of us had any certainty on what had happened. We were in a descent from approximately 20;000 feet and the air was smooth. It was then that I; the FO; noticed the left engine ITT spiking up around 900 and climbing. I was the Pilot Flying (PF) so the Captain began running the appropriate checklists on the QRH while the flight deck jumpseater remained available to assist with any other duties. The Captain then reduced the thrust lever on the left engine and we noticed that it caused no changes in ITT; N1 or N2. At this point; we realized we had an engine failure and did not initially realize it due to the low power setting during the descent. The Captain advised me to declare an emergency and we began running the QRH. We noticed a CAS message for Low Oil Pressure so the Captain ran the appropriate checklist on the QRH. The ITT temp was now exceeding 999 and then changed to '---' with a fuel flow indication of 0. After reaching the point on the checklist where a restart was an option; we came to the conclusion that there was no engine damage by noticing a significant cool down in ITT and positive rotation on both N1 and N2. We also noticed positive oil pressure so we agreed to attempt a restart. The Captain then attempted the restart the left engine while we all kept a close eye on the engine indications. When the restart was initiated; we all noticed a rapid increase in ITT as it spiked up passed 900. At that point; the Captain shut down the left engine once again and we all agreed that we would continue the flight on a single engine. After the second engine shut down; we noticed the ITT reducing again and there was no indication of a fire. We continued on with the single engine landing checklist and proceeded to receive landing instructions from ATC. The Captain made all the appropriate announcements and advised the FA of the situation in a very efficient and safe manner. After ATC gave us a runway; we began to brief the approach and prepare for the single engine landing procedures. At that time; the Captain expressed his desire to take the controls and conduct the landing. We both agreed and positive exchange of the controls was completed. At this point ATC offered us a longer runway. We then rebriefed the approach for the new runway assignment and continued on to the landing. The landing was executed flawlessly without any incident. Upon reaching the gate; maintenance was standing by to assist. We stood at the flight deck door to see the passengers out and we noticed that they were all calm and mostly unaware of the engine failure. This crew worked extremely well together in this very stressful situation and the communication between us was exemplary.",,"CRJ 200 Flight Crew experiences an engine failure during descent that is initially not detected but is felt as turbulence. The ITT is then noticed to be rising above limits and the engine is shut down. After shutdown all indications are normal and the Captain believes a restart should be attempted.

This was completed.  After deicing and warming the aircraft; the flight returned to the gate to board PAX and depart.  While at the gate; ice was still observed adhering to the fuselage in proximity to the main cabin door by both PAX and ground crew.  In addition; a deadheading (DH) pilot also observed ice.  Further examination showed that while the wings were clean and clear of contaminants; ice was still in fact found on the upper forward fuselage; and in the vicinity of the vertical stab.  The contaminant was not just frost; but appeared to be ice accumulated during an approach previously.  The aircraft was deiced again and the Ice Crew was instructed to do a more thorough post deice inspection. The Ice Crew did a good job of removing the frost.  However; the combination of extreme cold (below zero F) and night conditions for de-icing made it difficult for them to see and remove the extra contaminant.  The obvious threat is failure to comply w/ clean aircraft concept.  Had this flight been proceeding out for T/O (as is almost always the case) it would have left with contamination.  I do not consider this to have been a very high threat IN THIS CASE as the wings were clear and the horizontal stab appeared to be so as well; however; it is obvious that in a different scenario with other contaminants missed during the post deice inspection report an incident or accident could occur.  The station crew and de-ice crew did not seem to rush the job or seem negligent in any way; I believe the conditions and scenario created a situation where extra vigilance was required and they did not catch the ice.In the northern cities we sometimes find ice accumulation from the previous evening's approach when the conditions include extreme cold.  It is generally considered not a big deal; as we frequently deice for this or; as in this case; frost.  In the future; if deicing for frost; we will verbally verify the crew is aware of the extra contaminant and the inspection verifies the removal of such.",,,,"After de-icing of the gate; a CRJ700 Captain reports returning to the gate to board passengers.

There was no indication of departure other than just how scary it looked. Post shutdown inspection with mechanic revealed no indications on left landing gear or brake area that aircraft departed runway. I applied differential braking and stowed thrust reverse which allowed aircraft yaw to be corrected and aircraft to be slowly brought back to center of runway. Further braking turned out to be poor or nil for the rest of the rollout. Every time I hit the brakes we went in to another skid. I could not stop the aircraft until the very last brick of the runway. I applied intermittent braking all the way to gain some deceleration but it was a very close thing until the very end to determine if we would stop or not. Landing data showed us 7;330 feet for min braking for conditions. We should not be flying a large aircraft into this field at night to arrive just at tower opening. It is a short runway and information updates during flight planning and approach planning during flight comes from aged sources. MU data was a couple hours old; it indicated medium to poor braking (26; 24; 23 on one report and 28; 24; 24 on another report). Wind data indicated 170/ 10 knots. We planned on flying the RNAV to 17R. As we approached and tower opened; the wind was reported at 290/09 knots which forced us to have to reevaluate landing conditions while already in the approach phase; reload new approach (ILS to 35L); rebrief it; and recheck landing data for stop distance and crosswind component vs braking action in a relatively short time. All of that was accomplished and a stable approach executed. Since no other aircraft had landed recently we had no PIREPs to indicate runway condition and tower had reported the runway had been sanded and treated before we landed. This gave us a false sense of security as to runway conditions and not enough time to fully evaluate all factors. Had the tower been open; other aircraft landing and reporting conditions; we probably would have opted to go to our alternate. A short runway; non-tower ops; early morning landing in winter conditions; and a large aircraft are a serious safety problem. Stop flying large aircraft into this non-tower environment in early morning. Delay scheduled landing until after tower ops have been going for at least an hour or two so that approaching aircraft have better information to use to make earlier evaluations with more accurate data. This was a really close call. We are asking for a disaster here if we keep doing this.",,"Air carrier flight crew reports landing with Mu readings of 26; 24; 23 and finding the braking action to be nil.

While the surface winds are reported as less than a 10 knot tailwind; the winds on final down to 100 feet can be in excess of our limits.

Initial assigned heading out of OSI was 050. At OSI; heading assignment was changed to current heading (approximately 058) with a descent from 10;000 to 8;000. ATC advised of traffic passing our relative position for 28R and instructed us to maintain visual. ATC then advised us of a following flight to 28R and instructed us to remain visual; with a 3rd traffic notice about a Cessna at 3;000 (not a factor to our flight-distractor). We were given clearance to 7;000; and later 4;000 with 28R traffic in sight; and turned to heading 310 to intercept 28L; maintain 180 KIAS; and cleared for the visual to 28L. As we approached the extended 28L centerline; the Captain cautioned me to avoid overshooting the 28L centerline. The autopilot was still engaged and appeared to be headed for a slight overshoot of the 28L centerline; so I turned the autopilot off and aggressively moved to ensure we didn't cross the localizer. We were still far above the glideslope and I dropped the landing gear to attempt to descend more rapidly while maintaining 180 KIAS; and later 170 KIAS assigned. The 2nd traffic pointed out by NORCAL for 28R was slightly ahead of us and well below us. I asked the Captain to assist me with watching the traffic; which he did. After passing the San Mateo Bridge; maintaining 170 KIAS was impossible if a safe landing was to be made; so I started slowing to our target speed of 145 KIAS. As we lost altitude and airspeed our proximity to the parallel traffic became MUCH closer; and I began to think that they were attempting to line up on our assigned runway (28L). I maintained a high glide path while maneuvering a bit further left of course; when at about 1200 AGL; we received a traffic TCAS alert; and the parallel aircraft made an aggressive correction to the right (away from us). At this point I felt the conflict was over and returned to 28L centerline and continued my descent to the glideslope. Configuration changes to landing were normal; and stabilized approach criteria were adhered to. After being cleared for the visual approach and assigned 170 KIAS; NORCAL made no further transmissions to us. As we were approaching touchdown the Captain noted we weren't on Tower frequency nor had we received landing clearance (both of us had been distracted avoiding the parallel traffic). He initiated the change to Tower frequency and asked if we were cleared to land as I was initiating the flare (I was completely unaware that we didn't have landing clearance). Initially I thought I heard Tower reply 'negative' and I started to push the power up for a go-around while I asked the Captain to confirm the landing clearance. The Captain clearly stated that we were cleared to land; so I reduced power; flared; and landed about 2000 feet from the approach end. Clearing the runway and taxi in was uneventful.",,"My FO was flying into SFO getting vectored for a visual approach to 28L. The approach controller pointed out traffic for 28R. These runways are very closely spaced and the plane for 28R is supposed to fly to the right of the centerline until about 500 feet up then slide over. In addition; the controller is supposed to space us staggered - one slightly ahead of the other. When I questioned the controller who was going to lead she said she was still figuring that out. She never did and brought us to the approach almost together. We were slightly behind (less than an airplane length). None of that was terrible until the other plane blew through his course and into ours. We scooted over some and waited for him to get back on course which he finally did. Things were closer than I liked but it would be OK. We were about 100 feet when I realized the approach controller never turned us over to the tower. We were about to land without a clearance! I switched over to the tower frequency and snuck in a '[call sign] cleared to land?'…'Affirmative!'

After passing LOZIT on the GOLDEN GATE arrival; NORCAL advised us expect ILS 28R.  We set up and briefed ILS 28R.  Shortly after that NORCAL said change to ILS 28L.  On base NORCAL said change to ILS 28R; and cleared for the ILS 28R.  When NORCAL handed us off to SFO Tower about 2 miles prior to the bridge and we checked in with SFO tower they said after the bridge change to Runway 28L. We had ground contact visually and had approximately 4 miles visibility; but could not see the airport.  We felt that we would pick up the runway shortly. The First Officer; Pilot Monitoring; re-setup the FMC and flight directors for 28L and I took the airplane off autopilot and started a slight side step to the left; while we were waiting for the instruments to respond to the ILS 28L. Last minute runway change takes pilot monitoring out of the loop at a critical time. When the instruments responded to the reset we found ourselves to the left of the localizer; I believe this was due to a crosswind aloft from the East. As I was correcting for the localizer and just before deciding to go around because of the approach becoming unstable; the First Officer in the back right seat called the runway in sight to the right of the aircraft. Because of the conditions I decided the safest decision would be to continue to land. I discussed that with the 3 first officers and they agreed. I feel that NORCAL as well as SFO Tower do not realize that so many runway changes on an approach in IMC conditions is more difficult for the crew and takes them out of the loop at a critical time. I also feel that ATC does not realize how long it takes and how many steps there are to execute a runway change and properly brief each approach. I also feel that we as airline crew have a tendency to overly cooperate with ATC. I do not believe that our aircraft was in danger at any point but in retrospect I feel I should have either not accepted the clearance from tower to change runways or should have gone around in lieu of the change.",,"I believe the succession of approach changes (4) we received from LOZIT to final contributed to this event.

I told my captain; who then decided to maintain control of the aircraft and radios since his ND1 was still normal; asking me to perform the QRH procedure. At this time he also informed ATC of our degraded status. Once I found the procedure for a single FMGC failure; the captain expressed concern about these particular reset procedures and asked that we proceed carefully. As I read thru the QRH; I made a critical mistake and misread which CB to pull in order to reset FMGC 2. I as a result pulled the CB for FMGC 1 and caused further degradation; a dual FMGC failure. He asked that I call MTC for further help; which I did and spoke with our dispatcher; asking for Maintenance (MTC). We were on hold for almost 20 minutes; with the dispatcher trying multiple times to reach someone; but no one in MTC answered. At this point we were close enough to the airport and needed to focus on safely flying the plane; and he; the captain asked that I help him set up for a raw data approach; leaving the FMGC failure to be fixed on the ground. During this whole time; we had been descending on the arrival; with multiple controllers issuing us a 'fly direct to...'; 'cross XYZ at...' instructions; which we replied we were unable; so apparently ATC was confused with what we were unable to do; and not passing the word onto the next controller. We have some concern; although never directly told by ATC; that we may have missed or read back incorrectly or failed to follow ATC instructions during the arrival. Due to the work load caused by the degraded systems; we were rushed onto a revised STAR and approach with only raw data to navigate with.We landed without further incident.My lack of fully understanding the system failure and the QRH procedure; lead me to misread/misunderstand this particular FMGC reset. As a result I made the problem more complex and worse. This led us to high task saturation; potentially resulting in further errors. After reading thru this QRH procedure multiple times on the ground--although this mistake was mine--I feel the way the procedure is presented is extremely confusing and is not clear cut. I am also concerned that we were unable to reach MTC during my call with the dispatcher.Another thing that would have helped remove the pressure of the arrival would have been to declare an emergency since we no longer had either FMGC; this would have allowed ATC greater understanding of our degraded navigation status; and thereby giving us vectors and simple descent clearances.",,,,"After suffering the loss of the A321 First Officer's Nav display an error conducting the QRH to restore instead resulted in the loss of the Captain's as well.

First Officer (FO) was flying ILS to Runway XY which does not have a displaced threshold. It was a clear night and we could see the runway and PAPI prior to glideslope capture. As we intercepted the localizer to Runway XY; the FO's flight director went away. I still had both HUD and PFD flight directors and told him so. I asked him if he was ok to fly the raw data and he replied yes. His reply was quite affirmative. I didn't detect any hesitation. I told him I would back him up. Later; when we discussed the approach; he told me that he had been confident that he would be fine flying with just the raw data. It turns out that he struggled with maintaining glide slope. We remained on centerline the whole way to touchdown. But about three times got a dot low. Each time he corrected to get back on glide slope; but only got there the first time. As I looked out at the PAPI; they never showed us low when we actually were according to the ILS. I assumed he was looking at the PAPI and runway more than the raw data. It would explain why he was going a little low and not catching it right away until he referenced the raw data. It was also my perception at the time that this is why he was so steady on lateral course. This was a bad assumption on my part because the PAPI eventually showed us low and he did not correct as I would have expected. We are now on short final; and the PAPI went to a dot low; then as it hit 1.5 dots low we got the 'glideslope' callout which should have come at greater than a dot low. The ILS was also showing us now 1.5 dots low. I called out that he was 1.5 dots low. He flattened out the vertical speed until we were about a dot low and we landed about 500-700 feet down the runway. I had told the FO that I would back him up; yet said nothing during the approach until we got the 'glideslope' callout. I have always found raw data to give me the first hint of deviating and use it to this day even with a HUD. My expectation was that the FO would have no trouble VMC with the runway in sight using raw data to maintain a 3 degree glide slope. I was wrong. He admitted the next day that he had struggled more than he expected with just the raw data. Contributing to the deviation: 1. I allowed my comfort level with going low to be excessive since we were landing at a runway preceded by open water. 2. I allowed his total hours in the airplane to give me a false sense of 'he knows what he is doing.' The next day; when we discussed it; his perception of what happened was that the airplane experienced a series of 'sinkers' to which he responded with adding power. This was not what was actually going on. He was establishing something greater than a 3 degree glide slope. We were not getting slow and there was no shearing effect. By adding power he was getting some pitch up from vector thrust; but as soon as he reduced the power; we were back to the slightly excessive glide slope. I didn't recognize it at the time; but looking back and after discussing it with him; this is precisely what was happening. His visual perception of what the glide slope should be was off similar to the effect of vertigo on attitude. The lack of ground visual over the dark water was probably the reason. I asked the FO if he had ever flown raw data without a flight director in either the sim or airplane before. He couldn't remember for sure; but didn't think so. This might be something worth considering in training for both pilots. What will I do in the future?1. Stop assuming. From now on in my first preflight brief of a sequence I will explain that it is too risky to make any assumptions for either of us and we will verbally address all concerns. 2. With the loss of a FO flight director VMC I will either take the airplane; or actually back up with deviation callouts. IMC I will take the airplane.3. My comfort level with being low will not exceed a half dot regardless of the terrain. In terrain airports; it will be 1/4 dot. There is just no need to accept more.",,"LNAV/VNAV descent to 2000 feet MSL approximately 4 miles from IAF for ILS Runway XY. VMC upon level off. Continued at 2000 feet MSL to FAF.

The Captain then had a Flight Attendant come to the flight deck and the Captain then stood in the forward galley to smell the air. While standing in the forward galley; the Captain asked if any discolored panels or hot spots were detected in the cabin.  No discolored panels or hot spots were detected.  The presence of an unusual smell was detected by the Captain.  The smell could best be described as the smell of hot linen; the strong smell of a hot garment when an iron is immediately removed.  This smell was not the same as the usual smells in the airplane; such as a hot duct; an oily smell or even the occasional dirty sock smell in some aircraft.  The air did not seem to irritate the eyes.  The presence of the strange odor; which had increased during the flight; was enough to take the precaution of diverting the flight.

I brought it to the attention of the Captain and other FOs.  I made a Logbook entry and notified maintenance.  Per our dispatcher; the aircraft had not been operating for approximately six days (I assume it was in maintenance; in the hangar).  Maintenance came to the airplane very puzzled; of course.  Eventually they flipped the fire panel around and re-secured it.  I inquired as to the possibility of the actual indicators being cross wired and I was assured that the cannon plugs were unique between Left and Right and that couldn't happen.  Maintenance was also puzzled because they informed me that the length of the wires behind the panel should not allow for this reversal to have occurred.  I am concerned as to what maintenance procedure allowed for such a serious error to occur and also of the possibility that this aircraft has been operating revenue flights in this configuration for a while.

With the P-8 Engine Fire Panel installed in reversed; he was not sure if the individual cannon plugs could have been reversed; or cross-connected; creating a real dilemma in flight if they had unknowingly departed with the Engine Fire Panel installed backwards and a fire warning lit up one of the Fire handles.

This was approximately 12 hours into the flight. Approximately 90 minutes from destination all remaining bottled water was also gone. Approximately 275 people on board this aircraft had NO water; after flying for 12 hours+ in the well-known extremely low humidity conditions of a non-humidified aircraft. Upon realization that the potable water was empty; the captain directed the crew to ensure they had enough bottled water to provide for our basic physiological needs. Communications were established long before; when it was apparent that once again this flight would be severely short on water. Discussions ensued regarding the safest and best course of action for the passengers and crewmembers; including our suggestion to divert to Beijing to replenish the water supply. We passed essentially directly over Beijing shortly after the water ran empty. We were told that a diversion to Seoul South Korea would be much better for passenger considerations; however the flight time to get there would have been approximately the same as going to VHHH and therefore offer no relief to the situation. One would be naive to think operations wasn't well aware of this and therefore I view it as merely a non-option; lip service to allow them to say they offered us an option. Upon discussions among us crewmembers; we agreed that while margins of safety were indeed compromised; and passenger physiological needs were severely compromised; under these circumstances it was not unsafe to continue to Hong Kong; and therefore did so. It is of significant importance to note that extreme pressure to continue was applied by the operations manager and Duty Manager; their only verbal consideration being duty time issues for the crew (and the inability to continue if we diverted) and passenger issues diverting into mainland China. According to the operations management team; water (for 275+ people; on a 15 hour flight in less than 10% humidity) is a 'passenger convenience!'  Their words; not mine. 'They definitely did not want us diverting for a passenger convenience item.' This is very disturbing. Our condition: No water for 275+ people for 3 hours for basic consumption and physiological needs; after 12 hours of flight. A compromised toilet system. No water to wash hands for basic sanitary needs. Discovery that; as a result of the company's severely flawed directive to eliminate any 'excess' weight from the aircraft; they have also removed bottled 'hand wash' as well; leaving nothing but a limited supply of towelettes for sanitary washing needs. No supplemental water to fight a potential cabin fire; or immerse a potential burning laptop; tablet; or cell phone battery per safety procedures. It is also important to note that procedures were previously in place to load an appropriate -reduced- quantity of potable water based on flight time and passenger load; as opposed to the ill-advised decision to cap off and disable one of three potable water tanks. This decision removed no weight from the aircraft but removed all discretionary ability to load an adequate amount of water when needed. Furthermore; in response to a previous report of the same nature; I was told that company engineers have determined that 218 gallons of water is sufficient vs the 327 originally designed for this aircraft. I would suggest that based on my encounters; and numerous verbal reports I have received from others flying the 777 and running out of water; that these 'engineers' are either using flawed calculations; or using flawed assumptions when performing these calculations; or both. Either way; it appears Boeing engineers might be a little more adept at their job; as we are regularly running out of water on our long flights. Most importantly; this company's decision to remove 1/3 of our potable water is compromising the safety and basic physiological needs of passengers and crew.",,,,"B777 First Officer; on a 15 hour flight to VHHH; reports running out of potable water again due to the company's policy of only filling two of the potable water tanks to save weight.",

The weather was reported to be 1900 meters visibility; haze; smoke and light to variable winds. I believe we [were] leading the pack because we were told to maintain Mach .84 or greater and to cross Emrak at a certain time or earlier. When starting our descent we were told to cross Emrak at 18000 or below and continue to 15000. The frequency congestion was very heavy with other carriers and controllers blocking each other and asking to repeat ATC instructions. The communications with controllers was also difficult to understand. We were given a vector to a heading of 255 for the approach into Mumbai. We were also given altitude changes to cross at certain distances. We had complied with these instructions and given a descent to 1900 msl on a heading of 255 to intercept to LOC to runway 27. The captain and I both confirmed the altitude. The captain then read back the clearance for the ILS runway 27. We also had a Jumpseat rider that was also qualified on the aircraft listening in and backing us up. The controller never ever questioned our read back. The approach had gotten busy for us because we were told to keep our speed up in the descent and approach and trying to get down. The heading; altitude and descent that we were given flew us over a mountain ridge that set off the GPWS. I disengaged the autopilot (A/P) had hand flew while starting a climb but we had already passed the conflict. I reengaged the A/P; leveled off at 1900/2000 feet msl. The controller asked about our altitude and said we should have been at 2900 ft. msl. The captain told him he had cleared us down to 1900 ft. msl. The controller didn't say anything other than cleared for the approach and handed us over to the tower. We were cleared to land which we did and taxied in to our assigned spot. We proceeded to shut down and secure the aircraft which we did. At no point in time where we told contact ATC or talk to any ATC representative about what had happened. We as crew members must maintain an even higher level of vigilance when coming into airports such as Mumbai. The low visibility due to smoke/haze; terrain; and hard to understand controllers can make it very challenging. I had briefed what the MSA and GS but not the 2900 ft. msl on the profile. I could have briefed the approach better and asked about the 1900 ft. We had the mountain ridge in sight and clear of the conflict.

This resulted in loss of situational awareness; overshooting the LOC course; and a GPWS Alert requiring a second approach to land. While on the ground in HOM; First Officer/PM determined that the RMI had been selected to the ADF on both pointers; thus giving incorrect information of the Leadoff Radial. After going missed and on a safe course and altitude; having regained situational awareness; First Officer/PM contacted ATC to inform of the missed procedure. ATC said that Flight XYZ had a terrain warning and that the MSA in the area was in the 5;XXX MSL (not able to remember exact altitude at time of this statement); and thus since aircraft was above 6;XXX MSL (not able to remember exact alt at time of this statement); Captain/pilot flying (PF) leveled off aircraft while going direct to VOR. First Officer/PM asked Captain/PF if we were going to do the approach again and was told yes; so First Officer/PM briefed the Captain/PF the following: Direct VOR; fly outbound on the 003 radial to 11 DME to make a right hand turn at FOLAR; cross the leadoff radial and turn to 218 and fly the LOC inbound. First Officer/PM performed this brief to make sure First Officer/PM knew what the plan was because the Captain was the PF. Captain/PF agreed to the brief. ATC asked 'state intentions'. First Officer/PM requested LOC DME (BACK CRS RWY 22) as formerly briefed with the Captain/PF. ATC also asked if Flight XYZ had gotten the Localizer on the first try and First Officer/PM stated no (had flown past it). ATC cleared Flight XYZ for the approach; LOC DME (BACK CRS RWY 22); cleared aircraft to a lower altitude with stay on center until established on LOC; and gave us a phone number for crew to call when able. First Officer/PM repeated clearance and told ATC was not able to copy phone number at that time. Captain/PF flew the approach using the Captain's gauges; and First Officer/PM input the course needles to allow Captain/PF to fly. While Captain/PF was flying; First Officer/PM twisted VOR needle to count up to Lead-off Radial. First Officer/PM input the localizer course needle and verified with Captain/PF to point inbound needle to 038 degrees and not 218 degrees. First Officer/PM wanted to make sure he was pointing the needle correctly. Captain/PF agreed. Then Captain/PF called LOC alive. First Officer/PM made calls of fixes/distances/altitudes to descend to while inputting the step downs into the altitude alerter. First Officer/PM completed the Landing Checklist as requested by Captain/PF. Captain/PF landed normally in  HOM. After taxiing off the runway in  HOM; First Officer/PM radioed ATC to inform of safe on ground status and to close flight plan; First Officer/PM also asked ATC to repeat the phone number given in the air. After parking and deplaning; the Captain/PF called the number given by ATC and spoke with them. Captain/PF also called and spoke with Operations and the Assistant Chief Pilot. During this time; First Officer/PM noticed that the copilot side RMI was selected to dual ADF and not NAV as would have been required to be properly configured for calling Leadoff Radial. Other pertinent data: First Officer/PM attempted multiple times to hear the HOM weather report without success; despite repeatedly 'breaking squelch' on radio #2 to try to hear it starting 40 miles out from  HOM. ATC asked Flight XYZ whether we had received the weather report at  HOM; but First Officer/PM was not able to get HOM weather until approximately 5-6 miles from FOLAR (after 'breaking squelch' to get it; it came in abnormally weak and faint). This caused a delay in executing the descent to land checklist in the segment of flight just prior to approach to land procedures. When First Officer/PM contacted HOM local company frequency using radio #2 to give anupdate on landing time; company ground employee asked First Officer/PM to repeat data several times due to weak and broken transmission while Flight XYZ was on the approach. Company ground employee asked First Officer/PM about the weak and broken transmission once aircraft was on the ground. First Officer/PM is in high minimum status with less than 40 hours in type/121 crew environment/Alaska operations. Majority of prior duty times were on-call reserve status with multi-day gaps between flights.

I checked the weather at HOM to see if the aircraft was possibly on a visual approach. With the weather being marginal; I called out for air carrier X to see if the aircraft was on my frequency. I received no response. I called ENA FSS to see if aircraft was on frequency. As ENA FSS called out for the aircraft; I heard aircraft come up on my frequency. I issued a low altitude to aircraft; with no altitude to maintain as aircraft's target reacquired with their Mode-C at 5;500 feet and climbing. I did verify their altitude.

I did not issue a clearance to the VOR; however once established over the HOM VOR; I issued another [LOC/DME] BC RWY 22 Approach to HOM.

I selected both packs to high; and we reviewed the smoke and fumes removal procedure in the QRH; but the odor began dissipating. The cabin crew felt that they could continue to our destination. After conferring with the CSD; we deemed it advisable to contact our medical provider for consultation. They were unable to do so from the cabin; so I initiated a SATCOM call to the controlling dispatcher with the CSD present on the flight deck. The consulting physician recommended Tylenol and Oxygen if needed. Four portable Oxygen bottles were used by the cabin crew in flight. On approach the odor returned. One Flight Attendant vomited with others presenting renewed symptoms. I requested paramedics with Approach Control. This resulted in a phone call from me to Tower after gate arrival per request to comply with their reporting procedures. After deplaning; paramedics checked vital signs of affected cabin crew.

Upon reviewing the departure and reading the 30R initial climb instructions; we had put in the routing instruction altitude of FL190. Our failure came primarily because of the assumption that waypoint SPTNS was an 'at or above 5;000 feet' altitude as opposed to 'cross at' altitude.We were in IMC conditions after rotation and were being bounced around a bit by a 767 heavy wake that departed in front of us; and that kind of flustered us.  Other than that; conditions were calm.The altitude deviation was exacerbated by the pilot flying making the assumption that we were under class B airspace and could only fly at 200 knots; so the aircraft being relatively light and at full power was climbing at well over 3;000 feet per minute. When tower handed us off to departure; I did check in verbally that we were 2;000 feet climbing FL190. Within 3 minutes after departure; ATC told us to stop climb at around 7;000 feet and not to climb until passing waypoint SPTNS. I do believe that a transition to a faster climb speed would have probably made us cross SPTNS at 5000 feet.I did manage to call NorCal ATC when we arrived.  They did say that this is a new departure with the restrictions and are experiencing some growing pains with it. I guess my first suggestion would be to have Clearance assign the initial altitude. My other suggestion would be to put an alert box with the information sign on the TECKY1 like they have on the SJC9 departure plate. That is very easy to see and quickly identify. The SJC9 also has the maintain altitude at 5;000 feet and then also in bold letters.  This would be very helpful print on the TECKY1.The TECKY1 RNAV is a very simple looking departure and I think that CRM was lagging a bit because of that as well. As pilots I think we are a little more paranoid when we see many step climbs and altitude restrictions on departure or arrival plates. In retrospect I think both pilots should have read the departure out loud.",,"Misinterpretation of SID (TECKY ONE RNAV DEPARTURE)KSJC is underneath KSFO class B airspace (starts at 8000 ft.); climbing at 200 KIAS and combination of IMC; minimum safe altitude of 5600 msl; 19000 as transition altitude; resulted in crossing SPTNS fix at higher altitude than what's depicted in the SID. 19000 as initial altitude seemed logic since you want to get away from mountains surrounding airport as soon as you can. I should have asked clearance delivery to explain that clearance since it was pretty new. (Only two weeks out)On initial check in with departure PM stated 'CALL SIGN; 1200 climbing 19000'; ATC acknowledged.Clearance delivery should state 'climb via SID except maintain 5000' so there is no misinterpretation is it 5000 or 19000 ft. as initial altitude.",,"Flight crew reported deviating from an altitude restriction on the TECKY1 departure from SJC.

I was flying to TRK on an IFR flight plan. I had departed prior to sunset; although we were running behind schedule so I knew it would be getting dark upon arrival. I have done this before; never circling at night per the 'old' approach limitation and for terrain clearance safety reasons. As the flight progressed I was handed off to Oakland Center for approach services. At that time I asked what approach to expect and picked up automated weather at destination and was told that approach procedures to TRK were not authorized at night and it was up to pilot discretion if I wanted to accept a clearance. 'What' I thought? It wasn't even night yet and this had never applied to straight in approaches in the past at TRK. When I asked if it was night the ATC controller could not confirm and told me that the information was not posted and made available to them. I asked if there would be additional paperwork if I accepted the approach and said that I thought it was not 'night yet'. ATC did not have a comment or any guidance. I accepted the approach clearance. I believed that it was not the end of civil twilight at that time (therefore not technically 'night'); weather reported was approx 3;000 broken and well above straight in minimums for the runway 20 approach and winds were calm so circling would not be necessary. I flew the approach and broke out into visual conditions cancelling IFR upon visual contact with the airport and runway at approximately 9;000 FT; well above approach minimums. I landed without incident. After landing and shutdown I reviewed and discovered the new footnote on the new approach plate and also checked my arrival time and discovered that due to the confusing NEW footnote and approach limitation I may have accepted an approach clearance I otherwise shouldn't have. Even the airport management was unaware of this 'NEW' change; so were the aircraft that landed after me. Pilots were confused and many shared my frustration that not only is the footnote very misleading but should have been supplemented with a NOTAM or other change notice and clarified. Pilots do our best to be familiar with all available information; but with the constantly changing landscape it is sometimes difficult when a procedure has always been authorized and all of a sudden is updated such as this scenario without any additional NOTAM or info made available. Chart change NOTAM notices should include new approach limitations such as this. This particular change should be clarified in the briefing strip as well and not as a footnote at the bottom of the approach plate. Last; if an approach is not authorized and it is not an emergency; ATC should not be authorized to issue an approach clearance.",,,,"CE525 Captain is informed by ATC that night instrument approaches are no longer authorized at TRK.

Weather was clear and visibility unlimited. I was in complete landing configuration gear down full flaps; and on the glide path to the runway to complete a normal landing when a gulfstream told tower they were going to need a 360 to get slowed down. The tower asked me to make an immediate turn to heading 270 and circle around. I was less than 500 agl and short final. I made the turn to 270 as requested and the terrain system showed me two towers that were possible obstructions and I also saw them visually. I initiated a climb and turn to keep clear of obstructions and flew out over the lake to turn back to setup to land again. The tower turned me at a very low altitude over a populated residential area and into possible obstructions that I later confirmed are shown on the approach plate for RWY 33. Once landed I accidentally proceeded onto taxiway echo before I was cleared but was then was cleared to continue on that taxiway to the FBO. I expressed to the tower that I was not happy about the risky and unsafe situation he put me in and anyone living in the houses below if I had an engine out situation. The tower called the FBO and told me he could ask for my pilot number. I told him I would be happy to give it to him and I asked if he could explain to me the reason for the risky maneuver at a low altitude when I was setup to make a safe normal landing that he cleared me for and was already short final. He said the gulfstream was on an IFR flight plan period and insisted I was at pattern altitude. I believe the gulfstream was well over the 250 speed restriction as he asked for a 360 degree turn to slow down long before this all took place and I also think the tower was not spacing aircraft out properly. The turn off the runway onto a taxi I wasn't cleared for was my fault possibly out of frustration but did not pose any safety issues as he told me to continue as I was and it was ok.",,,,"A PA-32 pilot reported distress when; on final approach cleared and configured to land on Runway 33 at ISM; he was directed to turn left to 270 degrees apparently to accommodate a faster Gulfstream closing behind him that had performed a 360 to slow and lose altitude.

On the return trip; I departed ZZZ1 on IFR flight plan to ZZZ at XA:23 local. Run up was normal but during climb I noticed that the Alt Amp meter read zero and the JPI digital engine monitor was flashing 'BATT' indicating a discharging battery. I terminated the flight and retuned to ZZZ. I called the aircrafts owner who conferenced in the aircraft's mechanic. I described what I was seeing and they told me that it was normal for that aircraft and I should ignore the JPI as it will do that if there is moisture on the wires. A zero reading on the alt amp meter means that the battery is fully charged. I should only worry if the needle deflects below 0; which would indicate a discharging battery. I argued the point that I thought alt amp meters gave total amps being demanded from the system; but the mechanic ensured me that wasn't the case and that only occurs when the battery is charging. Once battery is fully charged; the meter will read close to 0. Accepting that the aircraft's owner and mechanic know the plane much better than I; I refiled the flight plan and departed ZZZ at XB:30 local. Again; run up was normal and the proper loads that I would expect on the meter were present. During climb; I saw the same 0 reading and the JPI flashing 'Batt' again. I continued the flight. I entered IMC XC:20 local. About 30 minutes later; the radios blanked out. I recycled the alternator and they came back for a brief moment than blanked out again. It was at that moment I realized that I had an electrical failure. I used my portable handheld transceiver to communicate with ATC and declare an emergency. I had no navigation equipment to fly the VOR approach into ZZZ. ATC vectored me to the airport and cleared me for a contact approach. Below 2000 feet I could see the ground and followed [the highway] to the airport. Contacting the tower on the handheld I was cleared to land. With the low power setting of the approach the alternator kicked back on and I was able to lower the gear normally. Once on the ground; the alternator and electrical was normal. Perhaps the higher RPM overloaded the voltage regulator. In hind sight; I should have trusted my knowledge of the instrument and had a mechanic at ZZZ1 check out the plane. Failing that; I should have remained in VFR conditions and landed at [at nearby airports] which were still VFR at the time. One other option was once the radios did fail in IMC; I could have reversed course and returned to VFR conditions. Luckily; I thought enough to bring a handheld transceiver.",,,,"PA28 pilot noticed that the Alt Amp meter read zero and the JPI digital engine monitor was flashing 'BATT' indicating a discharging battery; and returns to the departure airport.

The controller reported to us; and other aircraft on the frequency; that around that area of weather there was reported moderate turbulence from FL320 all the way up to FL360 or FL380; I cannot recall but we were about to hit that area. Being downwind of the weather; with the wind at around 63 knots out of the southwest and the reported turbulence; we decided to take a wide deviation to try to be as clear as possible of any eddies and/or downwind turbulence we may encounter; on top of the already reported moderate turbulence. Throughout the deviation we experienced 3 pockets; of about 10 seconds each; of moderate turbulence; while experiencing continuous light turbulence; most of it was due to erratic wind speed and direction changes inside the reported area. While deviating; the controller became worried that we were leaving radar coverage; and asked us how far or how long before we could turn on course to URSUS. I was still deviating; although we didn't have that much to go; and I told him that we had about another twenty miles before we could turn on course. He said that he was not painting any weather and I needed to turn to a heading of 220; I believe; to which I replied that we were unable to do so; that the most I could turn in about a minute would be a heading of 200 or 210; I cannot recall. He said he understood that I was using my PIC's emergency authority to not comply with an ATC instruction; to which I replied that that was affirmative. A minute later we were clear of the weather and we turned towards URSUS; letting the controller know we were done deviating. It is worth mentioning that while we were deviating; we could see on our Navigation Display's TCAS information; that there were a number of airplanes inside the area of weather we were painting; and where the controller said he wasn't painting anything. Those same airplanes were reporting moderate turbulence; so strong; we could actually hear the voice of the pilot talking; jumping around and changing tone due to the jolts they were experiencing. There was no way I was going to turn the aircraft any sooner towards URSUS. One; we were painting weather; and Two; those guys to our right were getting an awful ride; while ours was manageable.

Upon entering the clouds experienced excessive Nose Up Attitude which I believe increased the P210's left turning tendency. This combination of excessive Pitch Up and P-Factor caused the plane to veer left of the straight ahead climb to 1;800 MSL before the right turn called for by the DP. The excessive Nose Up trim triggered a red chevron (+20'?) on my Aspen 1000 PRO SV pointing toward the ground indicating a dangerously high Nose Up attitude. Realizing I was not in full control of the airplane my training to fly the airplane kicked in and I focused on reducing the Pitch Attitude to a normal climb attitude of +7.5' and rolling in the much needed right rudder trim. At all times my IAS remained above Vx (80 KIAS) but did descend below Vy (100 KIAS). At no time did the Stall Warning horn buzz. The Tower informed me that I was 'turning in the wrong direction' (Left rather than Right). Within what I estimate is 30 seconds of this announcement I broke out on top and then resumed course. My P210 was loaded to an aft - but within limits - CG (49' within a 37' - 52' range). I had not flown this airplane in this heavy (about 100 lbs. below gross weight) and aft CG W&B configuration before. I tried to compensate by wheeling in slightly less NOSE UP Trim and slightly more RIGHT RUDDER Trim. Obviously I had not compensated would have properly set a 7.5' Nose Up attitude and so free up more time to compensate with the additional Right Rudder Trim called for. Prior to this flight I had only flown in forward CG configurations so this unfamiliarity contributed to my poor takeoff performance. (The P210 is known for being Nose Heavy; when being flown (as I typically do) with neither mid nor rear seat passengers). In addition; my previous 1;000+/- flight hours were in Cessna pressurized Skymasters in which aft CG loadings were seldom a concern and; perhaps even more importantly required little; if any; Rudder Trim adjustments during Takeoff. So far as I know there was neither a terrain (I am familiar with the surrounding area) nor any traffic conflict. I plan to practice Full Power takeoffs (first VFR; then under the hood) in similar configurations to determine the appropriate aft CG Pre-Flight Takeoff Rudder and Nose Trim settings and to familiarize myself with the sensations such a Takeoff into the clouds may present.",,,,"C210 pilot reports taking off into IMC with a heavily loaded aircraft with an aft CG.

Approximately 20 miles east of the airport; while I was at 6;500 feet altitude; NORCAL advised me that flight following was terminated and squawk 1200. I descended to 1300 feet (approximate TPA for E16) over the private golf course; which is a well-established landmark three miles north of the airport; known to most pilots at South County Airport; as a landmark used to announce 45 degree entry for right downwind for E16 Runway 32. At this point; I heard another pilot announce that he was 'downwind' runway 32 in a Cessna airplane.Realizing that another airplane was maneuvering in the pattern; I proceeded to clearly announce my position; numerous times; over the course of the next five minutes...At no time did I hear the pilot of the other airplane make any announcement; other than the initial report of downwind when I was still over the golf course. I did not observe the airplane on the ground. Since it had been so long since I heard from the other airplane; I assumed he had either landed or left the vicinity. I assumed that if I was announcing my position; and if the other pilot made no attempt to announce his position; then the other airplane must not be a factor.At this time; a third airplane; announced that he was north of the airport and entering a right 45 for runway 32. Less than .25 mile from the approach end of the runway; on my short final; 30 degrees flaps; I saw the wings of another high wing airplane appear beneath me. He was maybe 30 feet below me and traveling slightly faster than me; so he was maybe 30 feet in front of me when I saw him. He must have been directly underneath me before he finally overtook me and I was able to see him.I became extremely agitated and shouted over the radio 'There's another airplane; near collision; going around!' I applied full power; climbed; and veered right slightly so that I could see the other airplane in my sight. The third airplane; said over the radio 'what happened?' I was still agitated and said 'some idiot just pulled out in front of me.' The pilot of the airplane that nearly hit me remained silent. I engaged in a heated discussion with the other airplane in the pattern and warned him about a reckless pilot who was now taxiing on the ground. At this point -- finally -- the pilot of [the offending Cessna] spoke up and said he was unaware of any near collision; and that he had 'announced' his position clearly. The other pilot [in the pattern] said 'I never heard you say anything; pal.' On the ground the pilot of [the offending Cessna]; who was still on the taxiway; contacted me by radio; and asked to come over to speak with me. I said OK. As I was tying down my airplane; he came over; shook my hand; but insisted that he had communicated clearly; and that he never saw me. He also at one point told me he was 'doing touch and go's' and 'was the only plane in the pattern.' He then got back in his plane; and departed runway 32 heading north.",,"I was involved in an almost mid air collision while on final approach at South County Airport (E16) in San Martin; CA. I was practicing landings; flew the second traffic pattern. While flying on the downwind leg for runway 32 I realized another airplane [was] entering the pattern on the right 45. A third aircraft was also in the pattern; following me and the other plane involved. I announced each traffic pattern leg on the radio; also hearing the other 2 planes. While I was on final approach I heard the plane behind me announcing that he is turning base. My thoughts were that this plane is following me pretty close. All the sudden I heard another pilot cursing on the radio; warning the 3rd guy that he almost had a mid air collision. I finished my landing without noticing anything of an incident. After taxiing off the runway I heard the involved pilot and the pilot of the third plane talking to each other on the radio. Just at that time I realized that they were actually talking about me and that it has been my plane that was involved in this incident. I taxied to the parking area and the other pilot parked his plane too. We talked to each other and he told me that he all the sudden saw me about 50 feet below him. Since I was the lower plane and was on final approach I had the right of way. Obviously the other pilot was flying the base leg closer to the runway than me. I had no chance seeing him; as I am in a high wing airplane and he was approaching from the blind spot over my wings to the right. On the other hand I cannot understand how he could not see me while he was on the base leg. He was flying a high wing aircraft too; a Cessna 150 or 152. He must have looked only to the right; direction runway; so he did not see me on final approach from the left. The pilot told me that he did not hear me on the radio; but I announced each and every leg. Before and after this incident I had no problem communicating with ATC. So I assume my radio working fine; as I could also hear the other pilots in the pattern talking. Maybe his volume was set too low. Anyway; even without radio I was flying all the time right in front of him; so I really cannot understand how this incident happened.",,"Reports from both pilots of an NMAC event at non-towered E16 provide classic narratives of the same event seen from different points of view...and cockpits.",

As I began my climb into VMC conditions; I began to develop large amounts of mixed rime and clear ice which my anti ice and deice systems could not keep up with.

Working the Quartz position; ZAB46 handed off Aircraft X a Non RNAV aircraft to me. ZAB46 coordinated the aircraft at 16;000 because of a parachute jump aircraft at 15;000 at Coolidge Airport (P08). Coolidge airport is approx. 42.6 miles from the PXR ASR-9 and 1.6 miles from the edge of the airspace. If the aircraft was to be jumping there then it would have been reasonable that there was a point out made to Phoenix TRACON Quartz; Willy or Santan positions since the aircraft is in close proximity to the area of jurisdiction (AOJ). But there was no point out made on the IFR parachute jump aircraft. The second issue I have is that when Aircraft X reported on frequency he advised me that he was tracking the PXR130R. The ZAB/P50 Letter of Agreement (LOA) states that the Non RNAV aircraft are to be on a 'RV thru BRDEY Gate expect direct to airport and cross the boundary/BRDEY.' Aircraft X was not on a vector; he was established on the PXR130R that places the aircraft in my airspace for approx. 1.5 miles before it enters departures (Santan) airspace without coordination. The aircraft cannot be contained within my airspace if ZAB46 continues to route traffic direct PXR or on a radial as they did. Reporting this to management falls on deaf ears and the FLM (Front Line Manager) usually states there is nothing I can do. This does not even comply with JO N7110.65 since the receiving controller does not know how he will be receiving the aircraft. What heading is he placed on? Paragraph 5-4-5 states: Advise the receiving controller of pertinent information not contained in the data block or flight progress strip unless covered in a LOA or facility directive. Pertinent information includes: 1. Assigned heading. Well what is in the current LOA does not comply with this since the receiving controller does not know what the 'Assigned heading' is! Why do we continually have to file reports on these types of events?  Even when this LOA was in the draft stage; the Article 48 workgroup and procedures Manager were advised that this did not meet the requirements set forth by headquarters recently when we had to rebrief these items via eLMS (Electronic Learning Management System)/verbally.This is unacceptable and both facilities know of this issue since the procedure went into effect and they have not resolved the issue. God forbid and aircraft is climbing out on the KATMAN departure; we will have a loss or worst a near midair. This needs to be resolved immediately but nobody appears to be doing anything to fix this issue. In the meantime ZAB46 controllers are not feeding the aircraft in accordance with the current LOA and there is no consistency either. Have the aircraft placed on a vector so it will be contained within the receiving controller's airspace. Require ZAB46 advice the receiving controller of the assigned heading as required by JO N7110.65 5-4-5g. Or place the heading that will be assigned in the LOA as is allowed.",,,,"P50 Controller describes two incidents involving the same aircraft.

We were running about ten minutes behind schedule due to the morning traffic for departures in XXX on our first leg.  I was the First Officer and the Pilot Flying for this leg.  Even though I have been to SJC previously; it has only been maybe three or four times.We had a computer that was MEL'd which I had never seen before and which was an unexpected add to my workload.  In hindsight I feel I may have been more focused on getting that information correct.  Our clearance was to 'climb via the SID' which was the TECKY1 out of SJC; which neither the Captain nor I had flown before.  It seemed straight forward and I did a departure briefing as the Pilot Flying.  On that departure there is an initial 'at or above' altitude followed by the hard 'at' altitude of 5;000 which is followed by another 'at or above' altitude.  The final climb altitude is FL 190 which I had set in the MCP.  When I briefed the departure I don't know if I just focused on the 'at or above' altitudes or was rushed; but I did not put the 5;000 hard altitude in the MCP.On the takeoff everything was normal.  The Captain checked on with NorCal Departure and stated we were climbing to FL 190 to which the Controller responded but did not query us as to whether we were climbing via the SID.  The captain later stated he assumed this meant we were climbing unrestricted to FL 190.  Autopilot was engaged approximately 4;000 and then I went to engage VNAV and it would not engage.  In hindsight I think this was due to the fact that we were already rapidly climbing to (or through) the hard altitude of 5;000 in the FMS departure; but at the time I couldn't figure out why it would not engage.  At about the same time ATC asked us to just level off at our current altitude and I pressed the Altitude Hold mode on the MCP.  The aircraft started a gradual level off at which time I think the Captain realized what had happened and stated he was taking the controls and manually did the level off at approximately 6;000.  We queried ATC whether they wanted us back to 5;000 and they said no; they would have a continuing climb to FL 190 in just a minute.",,"Although a deprature briefing was accomplished the wrong altitude in the window was not caught and VNAV was not selected after takeoff prior to 5000 feet.",,"A B737-700 First Officer set an incorrect altitude in the altitude window causing the crew to fly through an intermediate level off altitude while on the TECKY1 SID.

She was told that this passenger and her two travel companions were doctors and had come from an ebola area previously; but it was 22 days ago. The FA felt the doctors were being open and honest with us; and expressed that in their professional opinion (which since they worked in a hot zone would give them good insight) that the illness was NOT ebola related. We notified dispatch of the passenger who in turn notified medlink; company; and customs. The doctors opened the onboard medical kit and use 1 anti-nausea tablet. FA's kept the ill passenger away from other passengers and before landing moved the ill passenger and her companions to rear of aircraft near restroom. Cockpit was informed by dispatch that CDC would board at gate and evaluate the pass before disembarking any other pass. Just prior to the gate; we made PA telling pass that there was an ill passenger and customs has procedures for these events and everyone should remain seated to let them through to the passenger. Took about 15-20 minutes after parking for them to board. Customs and CDC followed their procedure (which took about an additional 35 minutes); collected personal contact information on everyone on board and then began letting passengers leave. The entire process at the gate was slow; with lots of different agencies involved (I saw police; customs; CDC; paramedics - just to name a few); but the passengers were informed via PA from us and the FA's; everyone seemed patient during the process; and we were able to avoid undue worry of passengers.",,"I was notified approximately mid-flight while on my break that a passenger had become ill.

We were lucky to be flying a new 767 aircraft with the newly installed predictive windshear equipment. This equipment is only installed on our newer 767 aircraft and that may have saved the day. Predictive windshear gave us approximately a 5 second head start on the windshear. Once the windshear aural stopped we cleaned up the aircraft and continued on the published missed approach. ATC assigned us 3000 feet and we maintained 3000 feet. The radar was attenuated and we could not see the next rain cell ahead. We entered a rain cell with moderate rain and turbulence which caused a sudden increase in airspeed from 230 knots to 275 knots. I pulled the thrust levers back to flight idle as the airspeed appeared that it might exceed 250 knots but the aircraft continued to accelerate to 275 knots. This brief momentary bump in airspeed only lasted a couple of seconds before the airspeed reduced back below 250 knots. I'm filing this report to document that the aircraft did exceed 250 KIAS below 10;000 feet while encountering windshear. I hope our company will install predictive windshear on all aircraft. I have replayed the scenario in my mind many times and the predictive windshear equipment played a huge role in the success our initial windshear recovery. Secondly; I've been on the 757 and 767 for 24 years and there has always been a problem with radar attenuation. I tried reducing the radar gain; but that did not help. Having the ability to have the Doppler Radar uplinked to the aircraft could be a lifesaving tool.

The day was going smooth and everyone seemed to be in good spirits as we grinded out the long day. There was no indication of anything wrong or abnormal until leg 4. I got the first indication that something was wrong as we were about to level off at cruise approximately 15-20 minutes into the flight. I was about to turn off the fasten seatbelt sign because it was very smooth when I noticed that one of the FA's was making an announcement and I proceeded to listen in. The B flight attendant (FA) was making an inappropriate; incoherent; and slurred announcement about a group of 3 passengers that were sitting in the back near her jump seat. I immediately called her on the intercom and advised her that I was not happy with her actions and that she needs to stop. I hung up and discussed what I had just witnessed with my First Officer (FO) and that I am concerned about her; as this was not her normal personality or behavior. We both then agreed to get the A FA on the intercom and see if she had noticed any changes in the behavior of the B FA. On the first attempt to just get the A on the phone; both of the FA's picked up. The B FA started speaking very loudly on the interphone about how she is 'back here partying and having fun with these 3 doctors.' I advised her that she needed to start acting more professional as her behavior was not appropriate. We hung up the phone and 1 min later I called again to try and isolate only the A FA on the phone. This time I was successful and she confirmed my observations. She advised me that the B FA is having trouble completing any coherent announcements and she is having trouble standing in the aisle. I advised her that I was going to turn on the fasten seat belt sign and that I feel they should stop the service and take their seats until I could get the dispatcher's opinion on how to proceed. Before we could hang up over the PA; I heard the B FA letting a passenger make a PA. I immediately and sternly ordered the B FA on the intercom to take her seat and don't get up. She became insubordinate and hung up the phone. The A FA agreed to try and speak with her and to stop the service as I called the company. This all happened in the course of a few minutes. The B FA went from no indication of anything wrong to 10 min later off the cliff. I got dispatch on the radio and we discussed the situation. At that time we made a joint decision that she was in need of evaluation and we needed management to meet us on the ground. I made the final decision that our destination was my nearest suitable airport to deal with this situation as we were only 30 min from touch down at the time. Dispatch agreed. I then turned my attention back to the cabin and through the intercom advised the FA's to just remain in their seats for the remainder of the flight. The A FA advised me that the B FA was not in her jump seat and was still partying with those same passengers. I then made a PA that we were approximately 25 min from touch down and that ATC had advised us that it was going to be turbulent and that I am asking all passengers and FA's to remain seated for everyone's safety. I then demanded the B FA to get on the phone. She did and continued to be insubordinate. I advised her that I wanted her in her seat now!!!; and that she is to remain strapped into her seat until we arrive at the gate. She got sassy but finally complied. When we got to the gate; a manager was there and the evaluation began. It was immediately obvious to all parties involved that she was impaired as she couldn't articulate anything to us. Another indication of her impairment was that she could barely walk up the jetway needing to use the handrails for support. Not sure if this situation could have been prevented. But upon further research a few days later I found out that in the FAM there is a procedure for A or B flight attendant incapacitation.Although I'm not sure it would have helped in this situation without causing a further cabin disturbance. I feel that; that procedure should be added into the Pilots FOM. I was only able to find guidance on Pilot incapacitation in our manual but it seems that they have a good procedure that should be incorporated into our manual or at the least referenced so that we know where to look.",,,,"Air carrier Captain reports discovering in flight that one of the Flight Attendants working the flight is inebriated.

The relief crew asked two different controllers. Both controllers told them to ask the next controller. About 50 min from ZSPD Capt. and First Officer (FO) resumed operation of the aircraft. We also inquired about approach in use and were passed on to the next controller. At this point the controller cleared us direct to the second fix on the arrival and handed us over to a new controller. We inquired what to expect after (second Fix) and were give the following clearance - Cleared for the SAS12i arrival. This starts at SASAN. The SAS12i was entered in to the FMC; It appeared normal on the legs page and the ND and was executed. LNAV was engaged. About 30 sec later I said why is the Aircraft turning. The Aircraft had turned 30 degrees to the left of desired heading. My immediate action was to select 'Heading Select' and turn the aircraft about 60 degrees in the opposite direction in order to get back on Course. It came to our realization the IAF SASAN never cycled thereby creating a classic problem of having the active waypoint behind us. The clearance to fly the approach was given either right before the IAF SASAN or on top of it. The IAF SASAN was literally at the back of the Aircraft Diamond on the Navigation Display. I estimate the error to be less than one mile left off course given the speed of about Kias 280. ATC asked why we were turning and we tried to convey this to ATC; I am however pretty sure the information was not understood. Contributing factors: 1. Chinese ATC not giving an approach clearance in a timely manner when requested.2. Operating crew did not catch that the aircraft was close enough that it might not Cycle properly; as there is a small delay in the FMC. 3. The FMC contains 19 pages of arrivals in to ZSPD each has several variations and multiple transitions. It is time consuming to figure out exactly which one is the correct approach. Even when selecting the Runway in use in this case RWY 16 there is still 7 FMC pages with variations and transitions. These are not readily identifiable when compared to Jeppesen approach plates. Several must be entered in to the FMC in order to be compared to a Jeppesen plate for verification. 4.

I thought it'd be a good idea in light of NOT a lot of KIND traffic. Upon a ATC radar vectored visual approach; backed up by a practice RNAV (GPS) RWY 05R approach; I had disengaged the autopilot at NO less than 500' AFE or nearing 1220' minimums or 5;000/1 for LNAV/VNAV. What happened next shortly after autopilot disconnecting was that the aircraft seemed to drift slightly to my right. The surface winds were about 050/6 (maybe from 040 - negligible). So; it appeared that there may have been 1 - 1 1/2 units of rudder trim already imputed. I trimmed towards neutral or 0 with the rudder trim control. The aircraft's bank angle was such that a slight or small right bank had developed (5-10 deg.?). Anyway; my goal at this point was to stop any drift towards the right of RWY centerline. So; applying left aileron control yoke pressure; it felt as if resistance was felt strongly enough to where the aircraft was now NOT responding to my inputs to correct and bank towards the left; slightly. My next measure was inputting some small incremental; left wing down aileron trim which definitely helped in my quest in that left small drift correction. Then did it seem as though the left aileron started responding. However; it still didn't seem quite as it should be. As if something was 'fighting' me on these inputs. The FO never had any hand on the control yoke as he had later stated when we had discussed it at the gate. I did write this condition up in the logbook. Furthermore; I had a lengthy conversation with two maintenance techs. I merely told them I had never experienced such a flight control sensation issue as this. I had given them as much information as I could assist them in troubleshooting this; as well as the pertinent details in the logbook write up. We did uneventfully touch down on or very close to the runway centerline. Nothing was ever said or communicated to Tower or Ground controllers about this issue. I was focused on flying the airplane safely and not wanting to induce any critical distractions this low to the ground. The FO and I debriefed this extensively while parked at the gate. I merely explained to him what I had experienced since he had very little feedback; other than what I had told him.",,,,"A B757 Captain; hand flying a practice RNAV (GPS) approach for proficiency development noted drift and bank conditions he attributed to an aileron or other roll control anomaly; advising roll control never felt 'quite as it should be.'",

Aircraft X was instructed to turn 20 degrees to the right for traffic (observing Aircraft Y tag up on code). I issued an IFR clearance to Aircraft Y; then turned Aircraft X further East. Do not issue the IFR clearance until prescribed separation is established.",,"I was giving a skill check to my developmental with his OJTI plugged in. I was sitting next to developmental plugged in a hand off position and monitoring the frequency and position. I did not have override capability. Aircraft X had did a couple practice approaches at PIE and had departed PIE in a north bound heading and recleared to TPA climbing to 3;000. I believe when Aircraft X was out of about 2;000 a VFR aircraft; Aircraft Y was calling looking for his IFR clearance off of CLW. The developmental gave the VFR his beacon code and to maintain VFR at or below 3;000. He then issued traffic to Aircraft X who did not see Aircraft Y. The developmental then turned Aircraft X to a 020 heading. The aircraft were probably about 2 miles apart when Aircraft Y tagged up with an altitude of 1;600 in a N-NE heading. The developmental told Aircraft Y radar contact and then went on to issue Aircraft Y his IFR clearance climbing to 4;000. The second the OJTI and I realize he is going to issue the clearance we are telling him 'NO'; STOP' but he kept on going. When he unkeyed Aircraft Y reads back his clearance. The whole time the clearance is being issued and read back the targets are on converging courses and losing altitude separation. The OJTI is telling the developmental to turn Aircraft X to 090 but when the developmental can finally say something he only tells him turn right heading 040. The OJTI tells him again 090 and developmental tell Aircraft X to turn right heading 090. The OJTI is also telling developmental to stop Aircraft Y altitude and I'm not sure if he got that transmission in. The whole time I can't believe what is happening and looking at the OJTI to do something to separate these two aircraft. After the developmental tells Aircraft X to turn right heading 090 it looks like he is in no hurry so after prompting from the OJTI he tells the pilot he really needs him to turn to 090. Aircraft X finally turned and separation increased at that point. I must say this developmental was assigned to me about a week and half ago on an extension from the training review board. His progress is not satisfactory and this was a required weekly skill check. I could not believe with his number of hours of training he has received that he would given Aircraft Y his clearance when they were not separated. I think his OJTI was shocked and momentarily forgot he had override capability and thats why he was giving the developmental verbal input. I think if the OJTI would have keyed over the developmental and taken command of the position the error would not have been as bad and maybe he could have stopped the clearance before it was issued. Myself; I should have been more verbal in my instructions to stop the clearance and then be more verbal and demand the OJTI take the position. I could also have reached around the developmental and unplugged him. Bottom line; I should have been more verbal and ordered the OJTI to take over the position and the OJTI on his own should have keyed over the developmental and taken control of his position.1. Use this event to remind OJTI's of the importance of not letting things go so far and remind them of their override capability.2. Lesson learned for me is believe what you are seeing and take control of the situation even if it means ordering someone to do something or unplug someone so they can't do more damage. I also have to understand that even though you have a 20 year VET as an OJTI they have lapse in judgment and sometimes need guidance.3. Provide skill enhancement training to my developmental.4. Have another discussion with OJTI about his responsibilities when training and talk about the situation again and how we both could have improved our performance.",,"TPA TRACON Controller describes a loss of separation with two aircraft.

Aircraft X was issued descend via the BLUZZ1 arrival landing north transition (on the star indicates RWY 36L/C/R). Pilot read back correct clearance. Because RWY 27 was broadcast on ATIS; pilot entered RWY 27 into FMS which; unknowingly to pilots and controllers; profiles the aircraft to descend as if MEM is in a south configuration (STAR shows RWY 18L/C/R and RWY 9/27 for south transition). The reason this is super unsafe is there is a 4;000 FT difference in what the airplane does as it transitions from ZME to Memphis approach as well as a 50 knot speed difference on the 2 different transitions.This is basically cut and paste from my report that was filed on [date removed]. Below is the response from the ERC: They had some issues with this when the new procedures were first implemented; but they have had very few issues with this recently. We did verify that the ATIS on the day in question announced that the active runways were 36L & R and 27. The R7 controller issued the BLUZZ arrival landing north. The pilot should have stayed on the transition he was cleared. If there was a lack of understanding; he should have asked the controller. There are notes on all of the STARs that expressly mention that ZME will issue the descend via and Memphis Approach will assign landing runway. Taking the RWY 9/27 transition off of the STARS is not really an option. The system has been clearly defined as to expectations from the aircraft involved. This was a case of the pilot assuming the transition would be for RWY 27. However; should we receive more reports of this happening we will revisit the issue.This has happened to myself twice in the past 32 days. If you haven't had enough reports it must be because the other controllers are not taking the time to submit the problems. Aircraft X was caught going below the altitude early and was back at the correct altitude before even going into approach airspace. Talking with M03 about this issue isn't the correct response this time. The only way I see a fix for this is to completely take RWY 9/27 off the chart like I said in the prior report. Aircraft X is based at MEM which makes it even worse because this pilot should know these procedures as well as anyone! Why is taking RWY 9/27 off the stars 'Not really an option'?",,,,"ZME Controller reports of a STAR that goes to three runways.

Approximately; 20 minutes into the flight another P.A. announcement was made that caused concern. We called back to the flight attendants to see how things were going and to communicate our aircraft swap and gate information with them. The flight attendant in question answered the interphone. She was talking very loudly and with slurred speech. She did not sound like her normal self. We both were very alarmed by this behavior. We completed that quick conversation with her; waited a few minutes and called back hoping that the 'A' flight attendant would answer the interphone; she did. We obtained her assessment of the 'B' flight attendant; which was that she was acting very strange to include talking loud and slurred speech. The 'A' flight attendant said she was embarrassed by her behavior and concerned that something was wrong. On the flight deck we decided to take action. We coordinated with the controlling dispatcher; requested medical assistance; and discussed a possible diversion. We called back to the cabin again to verify the 'A' flight attendants assessment. Once that was completed at no time did we feel the safety of flight was jeopardized? We talked to the controlling dispatcher and a joint decision was made between the captain; the controlling dispatcher and me to continue to our destination.

ATC issued an instruction to maintain FL240 and a speed of 290 KIAS. (I am not positive of these numbers but I am sure there was a modification to the arrival). Subsequent clearance was to descend via the arrival and normal speed. The next fix we were coming up on was SEEVR to cross below 23000 but above 20000. We set 8000 in the altitude select window and managed the speed and the altitude. This I am sure of. At this point we checked the FMS against the chart and both pilots verified the restrictions would be met. I then got busy with talking to the passengers to update arrival time and thank them for flying with us and such. Also called operations to get a gate assignment. When I finished with that I got back in the loop and noticed the airplane altitude was 17000 feet. I noticed we were not yet at SEEVR but the airplane had descended to the next fix after SEEVR altitude (BRDJE between 19000 and 17000). The altitude was constrained at 17000 at this point. We selected a level of at 17000 with a push of the VSI selector until we could figure out what happened. I immediately contacted center and told him we were 3000 feet to low at 17000 feet. He asked me if we were on the BRDJE arrival and if I was familiar with it to which I replied 'yes'. He said maintain 17000 and descend via the BRDJE arrival. There was no mention of a deviation and no traffic conflict of any kind. The remainder of the trip went without incident.I am not sure of what I can add to help resolve the problems associated with these arrivals other than to beat the same horse about monitor; monitor; monitor. I do not want it to be an excuse for my failure to fly the airplane at the proper altitude; but these arrivals have problems with our airplanes as well as other operators. I have a 30 year record with no altitude deviations other than the last month or so; and now I have two. Both of them on these new arrivals. I have lost confidence in the automation and how it works on these arrivals. I think that I will start flying them all in selected mode and just meet all the lower altitudes. I have observed this on several [other] Airline flights that I have jump seated to work on. Also; these arrivals may (probably would) work just fine if the controllers would not make modifications to the altitudes or the speeds. It defeats the purpose and intent of the arrival when it has to be adjusted manually to meet the requirements of ATC.",,"While enroute starting our initial descent into DFW we were given vectors off course for spacing. I believe it was 20 to the right of course. At the time we had just finished a restroom break. I was informed of the vector when I got back into the cockpit. ATC issued an instruction to maintain FL 240 and a speed of 290 KIAS. We were then instructed to proceed direct SEEVR. I was reviewing the arrival procedure and the approach plates for both 35C and 36L; and the airport diagram chart in case we got a late switch in runways. We were both then putting on our shoulder harnesses; putting our headsets on and getting ready for the approach checklist procedures. Before I realized it we were descending through 17200 feet still several miles from SEEVR. I immediately pressed the VSI selector to level the airplane off as I knew the altitude was not correct for our location. I am still fairly new to the airbus and the managed concept with the automation from the MCDU. I had put my confidence in this concept and it makes sense when you can see the constraints on the MCDU and the airplane is managed that it will follow the programming. I think that I will start flying them all in selected mode to meet all speeds and altitudes. I am not sure if being vectored off course for spacing and then direct to a fix on the arrival made the automation fail to capture the altitudes or not. The speed seems to not change; however on other arrivals I have noticed with the large speed window tolerance the aircraft allows it is easy to get slow on speed for some arrivals. I have been selecting speed when this occurs. It defeats the purpose and intent of the arrival when it has to be adjusted manually to meet the requirements of ATC.",,"After having been vectored off the BRDJE RNAV STAR to DFW and descend to FL240 an A320 flight crew was cleared direct to intercept the STAR at SEEVR; and cleared to descend via the arrival.

Shortly; they noticed that they had descended well beyond the minimum SEEVR crossing of FL200 although they had not yet reached that fix.

I have never previously encountered this.Prior to entering the clouds we had already turned on the anti ice and had green wing and cowl indication.  The bleed air had already been transferred to the APU to maximize air available for the anti ice system.  The picture of the ice is of the right wing. The left wing ice detection light didn't shine on the wing; so I couldn't see any ice on my side. The First Officer was flying so not looking back at his wing much.  We picked up moderate mixed ice on the descent and we did report it to approach.  After I arrived at the hotel I contacted dispatch and maintenance control to report what I had learned. I wanted to make sure other pilots were warned if coming in and I also wanted to have the ac checked for proper operation of the anti ice system as I didn't think there should be roll back like that on a hot wing.

Communication was established with the flight crew from the ground five minutes prior to a scheduled departure time of XA:00 pm. Crew requested clearance to pressurize hydraulics and shortly after 'clearance to push' was heard from the ground at XA:00 pm. During push and upon reaching the desired position for taxi the clearance to start engines was given from the ground and received by the crew. The flight crew report 'turning two' was received and acknowledged from the ground. 'Set brakes' was requested from the ground and received by the flight crew. After disconnecting tug and tow bar 'turning one' was stated from the flight deck and confirmed on the ground. The mechanic on headset then disconnected the steering pin and moved behind the nose landing gear. With the tug clear of the aircraft; on the left side and in view of the Captain; it was observed from the ground crew that the flight deck dome lights were extinguished then relit. At XA:15 pm; while the individual on ground communication was awaiting the call to clear the aircraft and display the steering bypass pin; the flight deck dome light was extinguished and the nose gear taxi light was illuminated. Immediately the mechanic attempted to alert the flight deck of his presence on the normal interphone channel. Seconds later the aircraft began rolling forward. [Mechanic Y]; the mechanic on headset; standing behind the nose gear; pulled loose the headset cord and began running away from the aircraft towards the tug on the left. After rolling approximately 10 feet for roughly five seconds; the aircraft came to a sudden stop. Aircraft alert ground personnel of danger with flashing or rotating beacons and taxi lights for movement. Mechanic Y was on headset that evening and knew that taxi light illumination was an advisory of movement. Aircraft stoppage had occurred after visual contact was established with the ground personnel in close proximity. The tug operator; Mechanic X; could not establish visual contact as he was without lighted wands and in view of only one flight crew member. Communication with the flight crew was lost. Procedures to establish visual contact with ground crew and steering pin [confirmation] were not followed.New procedures were implemented in ZZZ for aircraft towing/spotting. Ground crew reliance on flight crew procedures have been removed by establishing and maintaining constant visual contact with ground personnel from the flight deck. As per normal positioning procedures the individual on headset will remain a safe distance behind the nose landing gear and await the interphone call to disconnect. Removal of the steering bypass pin has been delayed until the all clear has been given from the flight crew and burnishing of the steering pin streamer/flag has been made more visible with hand held flashlights. After disconnecting from the aircraft; tug drivers will position themselves in front and in full view of both flight deck personnel. The tug driver will then set the brake and exit with lighted wands raised above his head until all ground crew are clear. [Recommend] All ground crews should assume a worst-case scenario and proactively protect against possible injury by staying in full view of both flight deck personnel. Precautions should be taken to position ground personnel away from areas of immediate danger; behind and away from the nose landing gear. There should be little to no dependence on aural communication. Maintenance Supervisor.

As we turned left around the terminal it was a very tight squeeze between left wing and terminal. Captain kept aircraft centered on yellow line and we were both watching carefully for obstructions including tugs and baggage carts. As we neared Runway 33; the yellow taxi line just disappeared so we stopped to figure out how to proceed. At that time; an RJ on short final executed a go-around at about 50-100 feet AGL. We realized it was because of our location; though Ground Control said nothing to us. I switched to Tower and asked if we caused the go-around. Tower replied yes and said we were supposed to hold short at hold bar abeam terminal before the left turn. He told us to then taxi via Runway 33 and Runway 8; then exit abeam Gate A2 and contact Ground. Upon contacting Ground; I asked if we misunderstood something from our taxi clearance. She said we were instructed to 'taxi via terminal ramp to Runway 33; stop at hold bar'. I explained that no mention was made about any hold short bar and none about that was read back by me. She said it's very confusing because they rarely issue the clearance to depart Runway 33; and that the hold bar is unlit and difficult to see. Nothing further was said. When taxiing to Runway 15; we are always told to taxi up and hold short of 8-26. We understood the lighted hold bar to apply to 8-26 only. The taxi instructions (with no mention of any hold bar) combined with the close proximity of numerous obstructions requiring eyes outside and to the left made this situation very difficult and our outcome likely. ATC made no stink whatsoever which tells me they know their instructions led us right into the trap.",,"Departing BUR; Ground Control directed us to 'taxi to Runway 33 via the terminal ramp'. We were expecting 15; so we delayed taxiing until we reprogrammed the FMC; and re-briefed the departure. Per the ATC instructions; I taxied west on the terminal ramp in the direction of Runway 33. Due to the proximity of the terminal building and ground equipment; I proceeded very slowly and deliberately. Also; I have never departed Runway 33 and was unfamiliar with that area of the airport. I turned south following the taxi line initially and stopped when I didn't see a taxi line or any familiar signage. No one said a word to us as we taxied. At this point; the First Officer (FO) switched to the Tower frequency. We were informed that we had crossed a hold short line. I never saw the line. Eventually we were given instructions to taxi back to the terminal ramp in front of the Company gates and contact Ground Control. The FO asked the Ground Controller if we had missed something. She replied that she had instructed us to' taxi via the terminal ramp and hold short of the second hold short line'. Neither of us recall that instruction. That is not what the FO read back either. She further stated that it is easy to miss at night especially if you are unfamiliar. The Ground Controller then had us taxi west on the ramp again and hold short of Runway 33. This time I saw the hold short line because I was searching for it. I believe we didn't see it the first time because it was dark; the line was unlit; it is located in a confusing location; and we were so focused on not hitting anything while moving in cramped; unfamiliar territory. We were then instructed to back-taxi on Runway 33 and cleared for takeoff. First; I have to be more vigilant while taxiing and reviewing my charts. Although I felt I had done what was necessary to mitigate the risks (chart review: 10-7; 10-9; briefs; hyper focus); I still missed it. I did not see the safety alert until after the event. Had I reviewed that chart; this would not have happened. I believe this is one of the challenges of the EFB as well. Previously; the red bordered safety alert page would have stood out. Today; unless you specifically select a chart for review; you have no idea. Lesson learned. Secondly; I think the Burbank Ground Controllers could do a lot more while issuing instructions during this configuration. Since this is not the 'Normal' departure runway; ATC should alert Crews to the difficult to see hold short markings and the non-standard takeoff procedure (back-taxi into position). If the Controller had said 'taxi straight ahead and hold short of Runway 33. Expect to back-taxi for takeoff'; Crews would then be alerted that the hold short is not at the departure end of the runway. Further; I think the airport should make the hold short line for Runway 33 lighted just like the 8-26 hold line. This would make it very difficult to miss; particularly at night. I also think the 10-7 page should address this scenario specifically for Runway 33 departures. The 10-9 page should have either a note or a hot spot designation that shows you can't turn the corner without crossing a hold line. Those chart additions might serve as another layer to the safety alert given that it is more likely to be in view while taxiing.",,"B737 flight crew reports being cleared to taxi via the ramp taxiway to Runway 33 at BUR for a night departure.

Prior to descent; the PM retrieved the iPad for the approach. The iPad only increased its charge from 3% to 5% even though it was plugged in for over an hour. This will be a factor later in the approach. The pilot flying (PF) was also recharging his iPad during the flight. His iPad received a sufficient charge.During a CAT I approach to RWY 9R at PHL; the aircraft was vectored off the STAR for vectors to intercept the LOC. The PF realized he had inserted the Converging ILS V RWY 9R instead of the ILS Z RWY 9R. The PF informed the PM that he had the wrong approach in and was changing it. The PM misunderstood the comments thinking that the PF was only commenting on the two different ILS approaches to RWY 9R.The PM was reviewing the approach on his iPad and noticed he only had 3% power remaining. The PM did not want to change any pages on the iPad for fear of using all the power prior to the approach being completed. When the PF changed the approach; he inadvertently inserted the ILS RWY 9L. Neither the PF nor the PM noticed the incorrect approach in the FMC. When the glide slope (GS) was captured and the PF selected/confirmed the missed approach altitude; the aircraft broke off of the GS and began to drift slightly above GS. The PF intervened and adjusted the sink rate to re-intercept the GS.About that time; ATC asked if we were having any difficulty. The PM responded no because the PM believed ATC was concerned about the position of the aircraft above the GS and at the time of the ATC transmission; the aircraft was correcting back to GS capture. GS was re-established and the approach was continued. ATC made a second query about any problems just as we were breaking out visually. Simultaneously; the PF initiated a go-around; ATC commented that we were approaching RWY 9L and should go around and the PM visually picked up RWY 9R and commanded a go-around.We accomplished a go-around and were handed off to approach control for sequencing. Once established in a stable configuration and airspeed on downwind we began analyzing what was wrong. We asked ATC for an extended downwind to give us more time to analyze the situation. Fuel was not an issue. It was then we noticed that the ILS to RWY 9L was in the FMC instead of the ILS Z RWY 9R. We surmised that the PF must have inadvertently inserted the wrong approach when we realized that initially he had inserted the converging ILS to RWY 9R and needed to make a change.

Shortly after I took the position; the CIC (Controller in Charge) combined CIC with Ground Control (GC). This is a common occurrence at BUR; especially at night; as our current staffing does not allow for all of our positions to be staffed without someone being on position for over two hours. We often have no supervisor for a shift; and we never have a supervisor past XA:00 Local; so the CIC position must be staffed by a controller from the front line. By having CIC combined with GC; LUAW (Line Up and Wait) operations were suspended; as LUAW is not allowed if CIC is combined with a control position.Aircraft X was on about a four-mile final and cleared to land RWY 8 (Visual Approach) when I got an IFR release on Aircraft Y; who was at the end of Taxiway Alpha and prepared to depart from RWY 15. Normally I would LUAW the departing aircraft and evaluate the situation; but LUAW was suspended due to CIC being combined with GC. I asked Aircraft Y if he was ready to go and he replied in the affirmative. I advised him of company traffic on final for RWY 8 and cleared him for takeoff without delay on RWY 15. Prior to clearing him for takeoff; I re-evaluated the situation and was confident due to the arriving aircraft's distance and airspeed (140 knots groundspeed). This was within my comfort zone and I have had similar situations work out just fine in the past. (The intersection of RWY 8/15 is about a mile from the RWY 15 threshold). I continued monitoring the situation and I became less and less comfortable as it unfolded. The departing aircraft took longer to roll than I had anticipated (the turn from Taxiway Alpha onto runway 15 is almost 180 degrees); and as Aircraft Y was about 1;000 feet into his takeoff roll I cancelled his takeoff clearance. The pilot informed me that he was already in takeoff roll and unable to abort. I realized that the situation would be much tighter than I had anticipated; but it was going to work out and the departing aircraft would be through the intersection prior to the arriving aircraft crossing the RWY 8 threshold. After hearing this exchange; the pilot of Aircraft X; now on about a one-mile final; executed a pilot-initiated go-around. I now had an aircraft rolling RWY 15 and starting his rotation and an aircraft executing a go-around for RWY 8; which made the situation much worse. I have filed numerous reports in the past about the dangerous situation with BUR's missed approach procedures. About a year ago we were informed that due to the lack of a DVA (Diverse Vector Area) at BUR; we cannot vector missed approaches (which we had been doing safely for decades) and that in the event of a go-around; an aircraft on an instrument approach must only be issued the published MAP (which turns them 180 degrees and puts them right into the face of anyone on approach behind them). In the case of a go-around on a Visual Approach; we have been instructed that we may only tell the aircraft to make right traffic to RWY 8 and we must then re-sequence the aircraft to the airport ourselves; which puts the aircraft in direct conflict with VNY airspace and departures; as VNY is only five miles west of BUR. The pilot of Aircraft X asked me what to do; and I had no good answer for him. The only thing I was allowed to do was tell him to make right traffic back to RWY 8; and if I gave him that instruction there was a good chance that he would collide with company who was departing off RWY 15 and turning to a 210 heading for his SID. I told Aircraft X to start a climb to 4;000 and to offset to the left as soon as able; as company was rolling on RWY 15. This was the only way I could keep the airplanes apart. The GC/CIC jumped on the line with TRACON and informed them of the missed approach and said that we wanted to ship Aircraft X back to them to be re-sequenced; as there was another aircraft now on about a 5-mile final to RWY 8. If I followed our procedure and kept Aircraft X in right traffic I would have to extend him to about ten miles outside of our airspace in order to re-sequence him to RWY 8; and I would have to violate VNY's airspace to do that; which could have also put Aircraft X into conflict with any releases off VNY; not to mention any VFR traffic in VNY's airspace. TRACON said he would take the aircraft back. After the departing Aircraft Y was off the runway and turning to his SID heading; I told Aircraft X to make right traffic to RWY 8; as I needed him to turn right and I wasn't allowed to issue him a vector. At that point TRACON jumped on the shout line and asked me why I wasn't putting Aircraft X on a 210 heading (the SID heading); which is the old procedure that we used to have but has been illegal for a year. I told the TRACON controller that I wasn't allowed to do that; and asked him if that was what he was requesting. He answered in the affirmative. I then issued Aircraft X a 210 heading and a climb to 4;000. I had both aircraft in sight out the window and at that point they had more than 1;000 feet vertical separation. When the departing Aircraft Y was out of 5;000; I shipped Aircraft X back to TRACON.There are two main issues here: (1) I have been filing report after report about how dangerous the situation with the BUR MAP (or lack thereof) is. We are not able to control IFR aircraft that go around at BUR. We can only issue them the published MAP (if they're on the ILS); which turns them 180 degrees and makes them climb through anyone else who is on approach to the airport; and if they're on a Visual Approach; we can only tell them to make right traffic back to the runway. We cannot give any instructions other than that. In tonight's case; issuing the only instructions I was allowed to issue the aircraft would have put them together.My recommendation is the same as it has been in the numerous other reports that I have filed: We need to be able to vector aircraft in the airspace like we had been doing for years and years before. The previous procedure was to issue the go-around aircraft the SID heading and altitude; which essentially turned it into a 'departure' and gave it to TRACON for re-sequencing. If a DVA is necessary to make that happen; then get us a DVA and get it to us now. I am an air traffic controller; let me control the aircraft in my airspace. Telling me that I can only do one thing with an aircraft that is going around; especially when that one thing will put the aircraft in direct conflict with other aircraft; is an incredibly dangerous procedure. If I didn't have my hands tied by these procedures; I would have been able to tell Aircraft X to overfly the airport; then given him a 120 heading (the SID heading off RWY 8) just to get him turning; then ultimately put him back on a 210 heading once I had space with the departing Aircraft Y. As it is; by telling him to make right traffic back to the airport (the only way I can turn him; since I can't issue him a heading); he turned right back toward the departing aircraft.(2) Staffing at BUR has been an issue for quite some time. As I mentioned before; it is commonplace for the CIC to have to combine with GC in order to keep people from being on position for more than two hours. This is a constant at nighttime; but it also happens during the daytime; as there are many times when a controller has to be pulled from the front line to staff CIC because a supervisor isn't able to be in the cab. In my opinion; the CIC position should only be combined with GC if absolutely necessary and it should not be a common practice just to keep breaks going. We lose LUAW every time we combine CIC with GC. This should not be the norm. It should be something that happens rarely and only when we have absolutely no other choice. On my end; I will be running traffic much more conservatively from now on when I don't have LUAW. As I mentioned; as the situation started out; it was well within my comfort zone; but it dissolved rapidly; and this was an example of how quickly such a thing can happen.",,,,"BUR Tower Controller describes an operation where a departure was slow to get airborne causing an aircraft on short final for a crossing runway to go-around. Now; the conflict is worsened by having no missed approach procedures to separate the aircraft.",

Aircraft X was the first in a line of three arrivals; all on visual approaches to Rwy 33. The procedure for VA's to Rwy 33 is for TRACON to bring the aircraft in on an extended left base; as this allows them to keep the planes away from both VNY airspace and LAX's Class B airspace. Aircraft X was cleared to land on Rwy 33. When he was about 100 feet AGL or less; the pilot initiated a go-around due to heavy windshear (gusts up to 55 knots). As I have mentioned in previous reports; the lack of missed approach procedures at BUR creates a dangerous situation any time an IFR aircraft goes around. We have been instructed that due to the lack of a DVA at BUR; we may not vector any IFR aircraft and the only instruction we can give to a go-around on a visual approach to runway 33 is to make left traffic back to runway 33. Making right traffic to runway 33 is not possible due to high terrain less than three miles northeast of the airport. In this case; Aircraft X was instructed to make left traffic back to runway 33; as this is the only thing we can tell him to do. Due to the turn radius of Aircraft X; this instruction forced the plane to violate Class D airspace at both WHP and VNY. Coordination was a nightmare and luckily there were no VFR aircraft in the way; although that was just out of sheer luck. Additionally; Aircraft X was #1 in a sequence of 3. Our procedure says that with a visual approach; we must keep the aircraft in the pattern and re-sequence him to the airport. In order to accomplish this; in this case we would have had to take the aircraft about 10 to 15 miles out of our airspace in order to make him #3; as by this time Aircraft Y; who was originally following Aircraft X to the airport; was starting his base-to-final turn and converging with Aircraft X; who was now on a left downwind for Rwy 33. TRACON ended up pulling Aircraft Y out of the sequence and in doing so they had to spin another aircraft; who was five miles behind Aircraft Y. This plan had us moving two planes off the approach in order to get one in. There was no positive separation with the Class D airspace around us; no positive separation with the VFR aircraft within those Class D areas; and a dangerous converging situation with Aircraft X and Aircraft Y until the Aircraft Y was pulled out by TRACON and the aircraft behind him was spun.As I've said ad nauseam; we need to get DVA's at BUR. This situation is dangerous. Before it was deemed illegal due to not having a DVA; this procedure would have been handled by issuing the go-around aircraft a 270 heading and a climb to 4;000 (SID instructions). This flight path keeps the aircraft away from all Class D airspace and allows the aircraft to be handed off back to TRACON; allowing the aircraft to be safely re-sequenced into an appropriate spot. The way it is now; we have no positive control and no way to control the aircraft. Having to have TRACON spin two aircraft on approach is ridiculous; especially when they're in a dirty configuration. Forcing our aircraft to violate Class D airspace full of VFR aircraft we're not talking to is downright dangerous.",,,,"BUR Tower Controller reports of a go-around and aircraft following it that need to be sequenced due to the go-around.

Pilot replied with hesitation 'FL240'. Fortunately the SBV controller had already taken action and descended his traffic. SBV Controller anticipated the A319's premature descent since we have been briefed that this is a problem with the airbus FMS.  The aircraft continued to descend to FL232 before climbing back to his assigned altitude of FL240.  All of this occurred prior to the MSTRD intersection.

I asked the previous controller whom I relieved if he had any prior knowledge of the aircraft.  He said he did not.  I contacted Clarksburg approach (CKB) to determine if they had any information about the flight.  They informed me that they had coordinated the aircraft with EKN sector at ZDC (sector W01).  I called W01 to confirm that they were working the aircraft.  They said they were.  When I informed the controller that the aircraft was fully in my airspace without coordination; a radar handoff; or communication transfer the controller seemed surprised.  He stated 'I thought he was in Charleston Approach's airspace.' (Airspace which was approximately 50 miles southwest of Aircraft X).  I grew immediately concerned that the aircraft had not been radar identified; but when I asked the W01 controller; they said it had been.  I asked them to initiate a handoff to my sector (after a failed attempt to hand Aircraft X to sector 21; the sector south of mine; I eventually got track control and communication transfer of the aircraft).  A few moments passed and I noticed a second flight plan for an aircraft X1 in my EDST. Its plot was far to the west of Aircraft X.  I called Charleston approach and they told me they were blocking for the aircraft at W01's request.  I grew concerned that the W01 controller did not actually know where the aircraft was.  I felt compelled to radar identify the aircraft and did so. As most events involving ZDC and its controllers; I feel the need to recommend an increase in training.  It seems that the nonchalant culture of that facility leads to errors like this.  The egregious oversight of airspace knowledge is beyond shocking.  In a region of our airspace; where the radar coverage is sometimes intermittent; to allow an aircraft to progress so far into another facility's airspace and 1.)  Not know to whom that airspace belongs. 2.)  Not know for certain where the aircraft actually was is disconcerting to say the least.  It is fortunate that there were not any non-radar operations in that vicinity; as there sometimes tends to be.  If events such as these were isolated; the tone of this narrative would be less tense.  Alas; ZDC's numerous errors and continuous disregard for adjacent facilities is cause to motivate a change in culture which is long overdue.",,,,"ZID Controller reports of an aircraft popping up in his airspace.

Flight itself was uneventful. His landing was smooth.  The 'spoilers' call was made. Nothing was unusual. The '80' call was made. We had planned and briefed using taxiway 'T' due to our gate assignment. At 80 knots I noticed the airplane started to drift a little right of centerline. FO asked if I was ready for it. 'My aircraft; your aircraft.' I used the tiller to redirect the aircraft straight ahead. I applied upper rudder to make sure the autobrakes were disengaged. I then noticed the deceleration was continuing. I made a comment to FO about the autobrakes not disengaging. I pushed hard on the upper rudder once again but had no success. I asked the FO to use his rudder pedals to disengage the brakes. He had no success. The airplane continued to a full stop on the runway with the autobrakes fully engaged. I did a quick assessment of any aircraft controls that could possibly impact the autobrakes. Both the FO and I used our rudder pedals again after the airplane was at a complete stop. Again; no success. I began manipulating the thrust levers and throttles. I cycled the reverser levers. I tried applying a small amount of power in reverse and then replaced the thrust levers in forward. Nothing worked. The brakes remained on. Tower asked us to expedite off the runway. FO responded with an 'unable.' Tower then asked if we had a problem. I keyed the mic and responded 'YES.' Tower asked the same question again; I repeated my response 'YES we have a problem.' Then I added 'The brakes were locked on.' That was probably not the best description for my problem but I wanted to keep it short while I was troubleshooting. What happen next surprised me very much. The FAA Tower controller; on his own and without my knowledge or consent from me; declared an emergency on another frequency. He did not tell me he had done that until later. The two aircraft behind me were both sent around. In my effort to continue assessing anything that might have an impact I reached down and cycled the parking brake to Park and back to Off. Within a second or two of doing that I felt the brakes release and the aircraft moved an inch or so. I told the FO that I think the brakes kicked off and I then applied a small amount of power. The airplane moved normally. I applied the brakes to make sure they worked and they did. I then slowly taxied off the runway toward the gate. I applied the brakes 4 or 5 times while taxiing to the gate. Everything was working normally. I sat there and assessed the situation. At this point the airplane was working normally and I had a full load of people who needed to go through customs. I saw no threat to safety and used my judgment as Captain to request clearance to the gate. My thoughts were that it was perfectly safe to do so and doing so would have the least negative impact on both company and the airport. In response tower said; 'You want to go to the gate?' I responded 'YES' He said to 'Hold my position and remain with him' And this is when I was first told that I was an emergency aircraft. I asked the FO 'Who declared an emergency?' He said he 'did not know but here comes the trucks.' I looked around and saw several emergency vehicles responding. I asked tower; 'Who declared this emergency?' He told me he did. Rather than get into an argument I simply told him that our problem was resolved and to 'cancel the emergency' He seemed upset that I was canceling the emergency and made a few incomplete statements over the air. They were confusing and incomprehensible. I keyed the mic and clarified my request. I explained that everything was working normally and that I wanted to taxi to the gate. I also explained that I needed no assistance. He told me to stand by and after about a minute he told me to contact Ramp Control. The FO switch to Ramp Tower and requested gate. We were instructed by ramp control to taxi to the gate. I did so without incident and checked the brakes several times while taxiing. Engine shutdown and the checklist was completed. I contacted Maintenance and told them I am going to need them and I told them what happened. They already knew. Someone knocked on the door. The FO opened it. Two people wanted in. The first told me to contact the FAA Tower and the 2nd was the emergency response lead. For whatever reason; the team leader seemed to think we had dangerously hot brakes and he was there to help. He was shocked when I told him our brakes were normal temperature. The hottest brake was the left inside but it was only at 250 degrees and normal. This guy seemed to think he was responding to an emergency due to hot brakes. He asked me about the emergency and I explained to him that I did not declare an emergency. He was surprised and told me he was told we were an emergency. After I explained to him what the Tower had done and that it was without any coordination from me he shook his head; smiled and just walked away. I then telephoned the FAA Tower and had an interesting conversation. He started by trying to second guess what happen but he had his facts very mixed up. He asked why I taxied after the emergency trucks were dispatched. I told him I was not told they were dispatched and I did not declare an emergency. He seemed confused (again) and he then asked me who gave me permission to taxi to the gate? I told him ramp control did. He was very surprised at that and his attitude started to change. He clarified; 'Ramp Control told you to taxi to the gate?' I reaffirmed that they did. He then say; 'OK we thought you did it without permission.' It was obvious to me that this guy was the one in the tower that began making the unilateral decisions. He had declared the emergency and has passed along information to the emergency crews that was incorrect and created the illusion that this was not only an emergency but it was a big deal emergency. It was done all without my knowledge. I explained to him that once the autobrakes released the brake pressure returned to normal. It was my decision as Captain (and my judgment) to taxi the airplane as I believed it was perfectly safe to do so. He then started being friendly and professional. I think he realized he had made a mistake and his assumptions were wrong. Maintenance then entered and did some tests but could not find anything wrong; He asked if I had tried recycling the nose wheel steering switch and I said no. That switch was in my planned sequence of things to try but the situation corrected itself before I got to it so I never moved the switch. I also never recycled the auto brake button but had looked at it and saw that it was illuminated. But again the situation corrected itself before I got to the button. I then called my dispatcher and discussed it. He took notes and then informed me of two important details that I was not aware of. He told me that he was told someone reported leaking fluid behind the aircraft as I taxied. Certainly no one did that on the frequency I was on and no one relayed the information to me. The post flight walk around did not reveal any such problem so I don't know where he got that information. I told him it was a bad and untrue rumor that I had no knowledge of. He then told me that the airport has had several similar incidents in recent months with similar results. He didn't go as far as to say it was the FAA Tower Controller but I got that impression. He chuckled and stopped the conversation so as not to place blame by rumor.  I understood and didn't press it. There is one more piece of information that may be a clue. On both flights to and from ZZZZ we had unusual heat build-up on the brake system. I know these brakes 'like to get hot;' but this was more than I usually see. In ZZZZ I actually checked the brake temperatures as we were cleared on the runway for takeoff. They were normal. But after the gear came up the ECAM went off indicating hot brakes. We took care of it but that is unusual. I discussedthis in detail with maintenance. Aircraft system malfunction and a Lack of proper coordination between Tower's reaction and the desires of the Captain. Listen to the ATC Communications and also the Cockpit voice recorder. Listen to where the breakdown occurred and retrain as needed. I fully understand that if an error is to be made that a conservative error is far better than otherwise. But unless there was a crash; fire or incapacitation; the Captain should always be involved in decisions that affect his airplane. In this incident; the Captain was not involved and was not informed. That alone caused most of the confusion and problems.",,,,"A321 Captain reported the flight crew could not release the autobrakes after a normal landing until after coming to a full stop and cycling the parking brake several times.",

There was Aircraft Y that was cleared for takeoff on 1R prior to us however we were ahead of and above the aircraft. As we were climbing through about 200 feet I looked out the right window and saw the other aircraft lower than us and behind us. I would estimate we were at about 500 feet and were flying the SSTIK1 RNAV departure. We had not yet started our turn to toward SSTIK per the procedure which calls for a turn direct to SSTIK at 520 feet. We were climbing at 1500 fpm or more when we received at 'Monitor vertical speed' Resolution Advisory (RA) from the TCAS. I glanced down at the PFD and the top of the red box was far below our current pitch attitude. As I looked at the VSI 'Clear of conflict' was announced by the TCAS and we were then starting our turn to the left. The whole TCAS event was over in less than five seconds. I do not know what SID the other aircraft was flying but from what I can gather the departure procedures at SFO may have been a significant cause of this particular RA. Per the SSTIK1 RNAV departure we were tracking the runway until 520 feet and not turning left as early as we would have been flying the PORTE6 departure. I am guessing that perhaps ATC intended for Aircraft Y to be ahead of us on the takeoff roll since they received their takeoff clearance before us but as it turned out we were the first aircraft off the runway. Maybe as the aircraft was behind and below us they pitched up relatively sharply and that could have been enough to momentarily cause a closure rate sufficient to trigger a TCAS RA. It may be wise to review the design of the SIDs at SFO; especially the newer RNAV SIDs.",,,,"Pilot reports of a RA that happened on departure with an aircraft also departing.",

Approximately one minute later we changed from tower to departure frequency and were alerted by departure control of the inbound aircraft. Simultaneously; the crew was in contact with [Ops.] announcing our departure from LEX (I had pin 3 turned off during departure.)

Aircraft Y announced over air-to-air that they would descend to 1800 feet and I replied that we would climb to 2200 feet. Visual contact was established - and confirmed with Aircraft Y - approximately 1 mile out and our paths crossed directly; resulting in roughly 400 feet separation. The TCAS was not functional in this aircraft. The specific reason has yet to be determined; but this failure was accepted as 'normal' by the crew because of a misunderstanding the functionality basics of TCAS. It was explained away as only working in 'certain' airspace environments (i.e. Class B airspace). Upon review of this incident; my research has shown otherwise; thus indicating an equipment failure. This incident suggests the possibility of a systemic issue of unfamiliarity with the function of TCAS and similar non-functioning systems in other aircraft. It is my recommendation that information be disseminated to all crews briefly explaining that TCAS is not dependent upon ground equipment and any failure to identify other aircraft is due to degradation of equipment.

During takeoff; at approximately 100 Knots; a small amount of smoke/fumes began to enter the cockpit through the air vents. I recognized the appearance and odor of the smoke to be from the deicing/anti-icing fluid since I had experienced this in the past. This was expected and the QRH cautions that this can happen when performing a Bleeds OFF takeoff after being deiced. However as the airspeed increased closer to V1; the smoke increased heavily to the point that visibility in the cockpit was almost zero. By the time that we recognized how bad the visibility was becoming; rejecting was not a good option because we were at V1 and we were concerned about departing the end of the runway if we rejected. I continued the takeoff by leaning forward to move my eyes closer to the instrument panel so that I could see the displays. I rotated and climbed away from the ground using instruments because visibility through the windows was zero. After climbing away from the ground and raising the landing gear; I removed the oxygen mask/goggles and was about to don them when I noticed that the smoke was slowly starting to dissipate.

I had briefed the First Officer on this possibility and asked if she was comfortable switching the takeoff data to a different runway that late in the ground phase.  She said 'yes; no problem; I have 3;000 hours in the Airbus at [her previous employer]; it is impossible to rush me.'  I told her if she didn't feel comfortable switching runways; or if she felt rushed; I would not accept the runway change.  She once again told me; 'no problem.'  We did all taxi checklist items without incident including checking the takeoff data for the planned runway for departure (8R).  When approaching the hold short for runway 8R we were instructed to go to the left side of the pad and plan for runway 12.  The First Officer then went heads down to load the runway 12 data into the FMGC.  Because it was dark and with multiple aircraft approaching the known hotspot at the converging hold short thresholds for both runways 8R and 12 I was focused on taxiing the aircraft into the proper hold short position for runway 12 while also avoiding and remaining clear of other aircraft as well as the runway 8R threshold.  In short; I was very concerned with not causing a runway incursion while maneuvering the aircraft to the hold short for runway 12.  As I was doing this [the First Officer] stated that she had successfully changed the takeoff data for runway 8R to our new runway; 12.  We were cleared for takeoff from 12 with an assigned heading of 110 and an altitude of 5000 feet.  I called for 'below the line' and we finished the taxi checklist and verified that the new runway; 12 was indeed on the ND as well as the FMCG.  I forgot to check that the V speeds were in the PFD and that the flex temp was on the EWD.  I positioned the aircraft for takeoff and set Flex as per the SOP.  I began our takeoff roll and within about 5 seconds I observed a master caution and the ECAM message 'ENG-thrust not set'  I quickly scanned the thrust lever position and determined that the thrust levers were in the correct position (flex) and as trained; and per the ECAM blue instructions; positioned the thrust levers to TOGA and continued the takeoff.  [The First Officer] incorrectly told me that the auto thrust was off; suggesting that was the cause of the message. She then read me the Vspeeds from the FMCG.  The takeoff was uneventful and I informed [the First Officer] that her assessment was incorrect; that the auto thrust as well as all systems were operating normally but that we didn't have a FLEX temp set so I had to select TOGA per the ECAM.  The rest of the flight was uneventful and proceeded normally.I think that a procedure should exist to recheck the takeoff data; FMCG; PFD; ND; and EWD that the correct runway takeoff data is indeed confirmed by both; pilot flying; as well as pilot monitoring entered into the PERF page when a runway change is made after initially checking the data previous on the taxi checklist.  As a side note; from a Human Factors standpoint; I feel I should have confirmed the new runway data to include the new FLEX temp on the EWD prior to taking the runway.  I also realize I missed the auto thrust arm annunciation on the FMA column 1.  If I had noticed that the auto thrust didn't arm when I selected FLEX I would have avoided the confusion of the ENG caution message.  I might attribute this mistake to the runway change and being in a 'rush to comply' with ATC high frequency demands.  I also believe that I put more trust into [the First Officer's] ability to perform the runway change in the FMCG due to her high level of experience in the Airbus and her reassuring me that she was more than capable to perform her duties without question.  I also believe that; being new to [our airline] and not as confident in [our] procedures as she apparently is with [those of her previous employers] caused her to fall back into what she most comfortable and confident in.  This caused her to mistakenly believe she had indeed entered the takeoff data in the FMGC.",,,,"A late change in the A319's takeoff runway and the flight crew's failure to program the associated flex thrust temperature prior to start of the roll; resulted in a EWD warning and the use of TOGA thrust for takeoff.

The reason for this ASAP report is; there seems to have been confusion regarding who the 'line-up and wait' instruction was for and the possibility that we may have assumed the instruction to be for us without positively hearing our call sign with the instruction (after the trigger from ground control previously; inquiring if we would be ready at the end).My thought on this is; we have to be more vigilant listening to our call sign when given instructions from ATC and query them if there is any doubt.",,,,"The flight crew of a CRJ200 taxiing for takeoff mistook a line up and wait clearance intended for another flight coming from the opposite side of the runway as being for them and entered the runway without a clearance.

As we approached the end of taxiway Echo there was an opposite facing aircraft and was not certain of who was next and could not get a word in to query ATC so I held short of the intersection just in case tower needed that aircraft to go first. Tower cleared the 757 for takeoff and I started my time just in case; 12 seconds later tower cleared us for takeoff on the same runway. Since I was a little ways back I knew it would take me a little time to get on the runway and start my takeoff roll. Both the First officer and I were a little confused by this a probably should have queried ATC immediately but as I stated I was not immediately ready for takeoff. We got lined up and I started to advance the trust at around 1min and 30 seconds after he cleared the 757 for takeoff. I did not stop on the runway or taxi any slower than normal but as I stated was slightly further back than normal. As we started to advance ATC queried us for not being airborne. My First Officer stated we were rolling and 'we needed space behind the heavy.' This made the controller mad and he started raising his voice stating if you need more time you need to let me know It's not a heavy!! We took off normally and Tower instructed us to contact departure and again stated we need to expedite the takeoff next time. I stated we were moving but that it was close to the heavy. Again more irritated than last time he stated it's not a heavy and all he needed was 6;000 feet between us and them. We didn't say anything else and switched over to Departure control. The next morning when we arrived at the gate I called ground control and got a number to the tower. I called them and they gave me to a supervisor who stated that Atlanta; Memphis and Louisville are part of the RECAT program which puts the 757 in class with almost every other large airplane and not a heavy. I told him I was aware of this program in Memphis but not yet at any other airports in the system. He stated they have been doing it in Atlanta for almost 6 months. I have the Memo 2012 for the MEM RECAT but have not seen any other memo's on this and was Not Aware that this practice was taking place in ATL. Again I'm not sure I could have expedited my take off much more but it apparently was not fast enough for the controller.I have consulted with other pilots and we have looked up the most current rules and regulations and could not find anywhere that states this is occurring in Atlanta. Clarification to the pilot group may help eliminate the need for this report having to be filed by another pilot.",,,,"An air carrier Captain reported ATL ATC was upset because the crew delayed their takeoff for spacing behind a B757 because they were not aware the RECAT program was in effect at ATL.",

Many of these changes were happening late on the arrival. I continued flying; while the Captain programmed in the change and we re-briefed the changes. The changes resulted in a lack of turn anticipation from the FMS/Autopilot turning the corner intersection (DOMNO) to downwind. As we reached the intersection; I noticed the discrepancy; and immediately overrode the automation; and then placed the autopilot in heading mode to get back to the next course leg without delay and re-engaged NAV mode after a proper intercept had been established. The arrival was resumed without further issue; and there were no comments from ATC.Had we not caught the error in time; it could have resulted in a significant overshoot of the turn which should have been started earlier. It is becoming common to have multiple changes in assignments of speed; altitude; crossing restrictions; and runways; often times this is late on the arrival when we are busy complying with the published restrictions. It appears that the FMS may have some shortcomings in handling these changes without introducing errors into the automation.I experienced a similar issue on a recent trip; but at the time thought it may have been a one-time fluke of the FMS; and we corrected in a similar manner. Since I have now seen this scenario twice; I realize it is a shortcoming of the FMS that must be corrected; double-checked and monitored; especially during turns of significance on an arrival. I have now submitted an ASAP for the previous occurrence as well. In the future; I specifically intend to watch my distance from the next fix; and if the turn has not begun prior to approximately 1.5 nm from the fix; I will be prepared to override the automation.

As I was the pilot flying (PF) at the time; I tried to focus my attention on the takeoff and departure but kept the information about the birds in the back of my head. As we climbed out I asked for the autopilot to be engaged and it was. As we approached our level off altitude (3;000 feet MSL) I attempted to monitor the controls and look outside the cockpit for the birds; but we were just starting to enter the weather and I was unable to see anything. Focusing back on the aircraft; I realized (along with the Captain) that it was not going to capture the assigned altitude. I disengaged the autopilot and attempted to level off but we still over shot by 200-300 feet. At the time we were also in a turn to an assigned heading (I don't remember the exact heading but it was in an easterly direction and we were in a right turn) but as I was attempting to bring the aircraft back to the correct altitude I decreased the rate of turn. Also around this time; my headset and microphone began to malfunction; cutting in and out and I was only hearing every couple of words and I believe only getting a few words out at a time as well. The flight director did not seem to be directing us in the direction we were originally assigned and amongst the confusion (the departure controller was extremely busy and there was a lot of chatter on the radio as well) I thought we had been assigned a new heading. Unfortunately; we had not and I do believe the Captain realized at this time that I was a bit confused and he took control of the aircraft. It was also about this time the departure controller realized we were not following the SID and he did then assign us a new heading and was able to vector us back on course with no more issues. As the controller handed us off to the next sector he advised us to contact the TRACON upon landing. The rest of the flight was uneventful.The biggest contributing factor here was my inexperience. I was still on IOE and not quite as familiar with the aircraft and FMS as I would have liked to have been. I learned a lot from that incident and as I continue flying I will gain more experience. I was already feeling much more confident as the tour went on and I got more experience manipulating the autopilot; FMS and flight director. Although I do appreciate the tower controller advising us of the birds; just prior to V1 is perhaps not the best time to announce that. I understand they have no idea where we are in our departure sequence; but maybe it would be better to give that information as they hand us off or even as they clear us for takeoff. Finally; although it was not the cause of the incident; the headset malfunction was certainly a distraction in the matter. I had not had any issues with it prior to that event and I did not have any issues for the rest of that flight. In fact it wasn't until the next day that I experienced it again and decided to swap out the battery. Everything was fine after that. There was no indication prior to the incident the battery was failing; but I think from now on I will ensure my headset has a fresh battery at the beginning of each tour.",,"We were given clearance to takeoff. Just prior to rotation speed the tower controller advised us of birds observed at the departure end of the runway. We were vigilant in looking for the reported birds until we entered IMC conditions. Approximately 500 feet prior to our assigned level off altitude of 3;000 feet; I noticed that the 'VALTS CAP' on my PFD did not display and knew that the autopilot; which was engaged; would not capture and hold the altitude. I advised the Second in Command of this but being fairly new to the aircraft; he was not aggressive enough with disengaging the autopilot and leveling at the assigned altitude. I then advised him that I had the aircraft and returned to the assigned altitude. During this time we received a momentary TCAS TA and were delayed in turning to the assigned heading.This is a good example of how a small distraction can lead to an event such as this. My suggestion is that tower controllers refrain from advisories such as this during critical phases such as takeoff rolls or after initial touchdown during landing when there is a high workload for both pilots.",,"A pilot new to the CE-560 was distracted by an ATC bird alert during takeoff rotation and overshot the first altitude.

One FA went to the back to store her bags and do her safety checks. She came back to 1L for air as the odor was overwhelming and uncomfortable. I informed the FS; Captain and Agent that I was uncomfortable inhaling the fumes; it is a health hazard; and might not be able to work the flight; depending on how severe the odor remained and its effect on my body. I was previously exposed to aircraft fumes and consequently developed severe health issues. The agent phoned zone to inform them of our situation. She was told to go ahead and board; (regardless of cabin air quality and potential health risk to passengers and crew). I took the greeter position; when I was able to step in and out of the cockpit for air; the cockpit did not smell of fumes and the air supply was on high flow. During the boarding; inflight supervisor came onboard. He also acknowledged the strong odor of jet fumes. The odor had not completely dissipated within the 35 minutes of boarding.

An attempt to reset the computer per Trouble Shooting Manual (TSM) 24-00-00-810 was not successful. At this point MEL 22-83-Y was complied with; for the FMGC-1 INOP. The CB was pulled and Autoland Status downgrade placard installed. Per MEL instruction MEL 34-48-E was also applied for the Terrain Avoidance and Warning System (TAWS) INOP. The aircraft pushed off the blocks for its next flight leg; but returned to the blocks when Dispatch advised that they could not dispatch the aircraft due to weather minimums. At this time; another CB cycle was attempted and was successful. The applicable Aircraft Maintenance Manual (AMM) test was completed Auto Flight System (AFS) Test 22-96-00 and all systems passed. The MEL 22-83-Y and 34-48-E procedures were reversed and the aircraft returned to normal configuration. The Autoland Status downgrade placard was also removed. A new Maintenance Release was completed and sent to the flight deck. The question has been raised as to the validity of the Autoland Status and if the Land Verify Test needed to be completed. At the time of the incident I did not feel the Land Verify Test was applicable for the following reasons:1) General Maintenance Manual (GMM) 05-35-40 states if a CAT II/III component of system is reported to be malfunctioning; it will require that the system test specified in the applicable AMM-FIM Fault Isolation Manual be accomplished. If a CAT II/III component; listed in the CAT component tables is replaced; reseated; swapped or associated wiring; plug or receptacle is disconnected; the Ground Recertification procedure must also be accomplished by a CAT II/III Qualified Technician before retaining or upgrading the CAT Status. NOTE: Cycling of circuit breakers does not require Ground recertification.        2) MEL General - Definitions: Takeoff: ...For purposes of MEL relief; this translates to the point at which the pilot physically begins to apply power to initiate the takeoff...All actions that were taken were within the applicable AMM; TSM and MEL requirements before the aircraft reached the point of dispatch. No system components were disturbed. The flight was never at the point of dispatch - movement of the throttles for takeoff. I do understand that if the aircraft indeed proceeded through the point of dispatch or actually flew; then a CAT recertification would have been necessary. As an additional note; there are systems that affect the CAT status of the aircraft; requiring CAT Downgrade placards being installed; that when repaired do not require a CAT recertification; only that the placard be removed. Ref MEL 24-03-0 for Engine Driven Generator Channel. ..If my interpretations of this are incorrect; then I believe a more clearly defined policy should be implemented such as: Before removing any Autoland Downgrade Placard; a Ground recertification must be accomplished.

The nature of the flight in question was instructional and centered around traffic pattern proficiency; thus terminal and local weather synopsis were sufficient for pre-flight review. Terminal cloud ceilings were textually reported at 1;500 feet AGL with scattered clouds existing around 300; ATIS broadcasting offered confirmation. With a warm occlusion powered by a maritime low to the south; I expected the cloud bases to gradually lower throughout the evening; however; no PIREPS were available to indicate any change to the current conditions. Departing runway 25; it is my understanding that a ceilometer exists just beyond the runway terminus; which dampened any concerns of encountering conditions other than reported during the initial climb. Pattern altitude established at 900 AGL; a determination was made to entertain the flight. Typically; any perceived anomaly in weather is relayed to the pilot during initial call-up. As none were addressed; I assumed none existed. With the student at the controls; we departed runway 25 as intended and began our initial climb in the upwind leg. At approximately 400 feet AGL (537 feet MSL); the aircraft entered hard IMC with no perceivable top. Visibility dropped to zero with no ground reference available. Knowing that the downtown structures loomed ahead; I immediately took control and executed a 90 degree left turn; reducing power to transition into a descent; during which Merrill Tower solicited a report of flight visibility. Break-out occurred at around 350 feet AGL over the Quebec Apron (south end of the airport) followed by an immediate landing on the departure runway. Though instrument proficient; inadvertent flight into IMC is by nature . . . inadvertent. Therefore no planning was made leading to perceptual upset; further delaying the reactive process. The hazards involved are well-known and the possibility exists that future events may not yield favorable results. Though Merrill has adequate weather reporting capability; field location is seasonally hampered by weather dynamics unique to the environment; leading to asymmetric field conditions. Tower/ground controllers are typically good about soliciting PIREPS from arriving traffic; but traffic must exist in the first place. I conclude that there was little that could be done to avoid this event based on the information available at the time. The reported weather conditions favored terminal flight well within my experience level and I believe my decision was justified on those grounds. Furthermore; the illusions associated with slant-range visibility and parallax make a visual ground estimation unreliable at best as the cloud ceilings looked adequate from my perspective. I would be hard-pressed to recommend additional technology as the requisite technology exists for data collection; though in this instance an anomaly may exist. However; due to the explained nature of Merrill's environment; it may not be outside reason to employ the services of a trained human observer as such an anomaly could be fatal.",,,,"A flight instructor and student pilot experience unexpected IFR conditions on climbout when the reported weather and visual conditions indicated that VFR operations would exist.",

We were cleared direct to ZZZ intersection and then were handed off to Center shortly after. We made successful contact with them. We then received clearance to fly Direct ZZZ1 intersection then Direct ZZZ2 intersection for the ZZZ Arrival. Some time passed when we noticed a quiet radio. I made several calls on the radio with the frequency present on our radio and got no response. I consulted the charts and found a frequency for Center for our current location. After tuning in 1XY.XX we discovered Center had been looking for us. We checked in immediately which was acknowledged by the controller. A short time later we were requested to call a phone number provided to us for a possible pilot deviation.After successfully landing with an inflight emergency; the pilot flying made the phone call as requested. We were informed of the following: we were switched from 1XX.XX to 1YY.XX -and we acknowledged; We never checked in on 1YY.XX; ATC tried contacting us without success; Several attempts were made by ATC to contact us without success; After contact was successfully reestablished on 1XY.XX; a total of 26 minutes of lost communication had elapsed; No conflict had resulted from the event.When we as a crew debriefed how this event could have possibly occurred; we thought of some possibilities and factors that could have caused this error [including little traffic and the possibility of mishearing/not hearing a frequency change].In the climb to cruising altitude; I noticed the left engine (#1 engine) appeared to have a higher ITT with a lower N1 speed than the right engine (#2 engine). This observation did not alarm me as there is usually a discrepancy between engines. After reaching cruise altitude; I performed the standard CRUISE checklist. The #1 engine appeared to have the same discrepancy. I performed a trend monitoring sheet on both engines after an hour of flying. This is when the performance of our number 1 engine became a little concerning but not too alarming as oil pressure and temps were observed to be slightly higher than usual but well within limits. At this time; I brought up my concerns to the other pilot. We adjusted the throttle of the #1 and observed oil pressure near the top of the green arc on our gauge; but well within limits. We reviewed past trend reports that were in our flight book and definitely observed higher than usual temps in both the oil and ITT and higher than usual oil pressure (All were within limits). We discussed possible causes including the possibility of faulty indications. We documented our observations with photos taken with an I-phone with the intention of notifying our maintenance personnel upon landing. We continued to make adjustments with the #1 throttle to keep the indications well within operating parameters and closely monitored all gauges in the cockpit. We reviewed checklists in the attempt to find a remedy for the unusual indications. Did our attention and focus become too narrowed to one aspect of the flight causing us to not complete the radio handoff? Very possible. Was there some sort of radio failure or signal interruption during this time? Possible; but unlikely. Any one singular factor or possibility or any combination of them could have led to this occurrence to have happened. As a note; upon descent the oil pressure became erratic and the cabin rapidly filled with smoke.

Earlier; Aircraft Y was cleared into IR126; but I wasn't made aware of it. I was made aware of Aircraft X and was given the exit time and requested altitude to coordinate with ZLA7. When I called ZLA7 to coordinate Aircraft X's exit time; they alerted me to Aircraft Y and its exit time; and the possible conflict. I had no track or information on my scope or EDST about Aircraft Y and verified they weren't mistaken on the time. I found out subsequently that Aircraft Y was cleared into IR126 a couple of controllers back; and the data block was dropped when ZLA7 did not take the handoff/transfer of the data block. While speaking to ZLA7 I asked of the known or estimated position of Aircraft Y. They didn't know and had to assume it was an overdue aircraft. Shortly thereafter Aircraft Y's beacon showed up in ZLA7's airspace right about the time and place it should've been; which was approximately 25 miles in front of Aircraft X's estimated position. I attempted to contact Aircraft X on all of my available frequencies to no avail. ZLA7 got ahold of Aircraft Y and climbed them above the IR126 altitudes. In the 19 years I've worked this airspace; and the countless times I've worked aircraft into IR126; I've never seen this occur. Turns out it was a possible pilot deviation (and being treated as such) because the scheduling agency made Aircraft X aware of Aircraft Y and the delay necessary to properly separate; only to have Aircraft X apparently circumvent that delay by entering at an alternate entry point further downstream along IR126. With the combining; changing of controllers and then de-combining of 36 (from 12); it might've added to the confusion. While exit time was coordinated; the data block of Aircraft Y's position was dropped; which is not uncommon with this procedure. I would suggest; and have always practiced; that the data block remain; be put in COAST status so it follows along with where the aircraft should be. I've found that even though it's a very long time with no radar; when the aircraft finally appears on radar (usually at the ZLA/ZDV boundary) the COAST track is very close to the actual aircraft. Somehow Aircraft Y's info fell out of the EDST; either by the previous controller or in the opening of sector 36. Had it been there; especially with the exit time in the scratchpad (which is a very common practice) the controller who cleared Aircraft X would've questioned the timing and if MARSA (Military Assumes Responsibility for Separation) was possible. We assume; rightly; that the scheduling authority will not put two aircraft into an IR route in conflict like this; which they did attempt; only to be overridden by the pilots; apparently. While the pilot is not required to monitor our frequency; they usually monitor guard. We used to have the ability to bring up VHF guard from Abajo Peak which has a possibility of reaching aircraft at low level in IR126. That ability to select it from the sector has been taken away; it probably shouldn't have. VHF guard would not have worked with Aircraft X possibly; but it would've with Aircraft Y.",,"As I was accepting the sector from the controller I was relieving; I was aware of Aircraft Y in IR-126. The relieving controller said he would pass the exit estimate to LA Center before leaving. I tracked the flight after they entered the IR route until the target dropped from radar. I initiated a coast track which worked for a while; but then it started free tracking. I moved the data block close to the ZLA boundary and initiated a handoff; which they ignored. After a while; I dropped the data block and continued working.A while later I received a handoff on Aircraft X from Albuquerque Center going into IR-126A. I cleared the aircraft into IR-126A after receiving the exit estimate and requested altitude upon exit. At that moment my sector was getting split off and I verbally coordinated with the receiving controller the estimates that he would need to pass to LA Center. When he passed the information; LA center asked about Aircraft Y. It is my understanding that the military schedules the entrance and exits of their military aircraft in the IR routes. Since the entrance is in one Center and the exit is in another Center; how would we ever know it the preceding aircraft has exited or not?",,"ZDV controllers report of an unsafe situation where they uncertain where two aircraft were since one aircraft was in the COAST mode.

We verified the altitude on our approach plates and in the FMC and the First Officer (Pilot Flying) rolled 6;000 feet into the FMC and continued descent in VNAV as previously cleared. Several minutes later while descending on the arrival through 7;000 feet; Approach Control queried us about our altitude assignment. We responded that our last clearance was to descend via the BLOGS 1 Arrival. Approach Control then directed us to climb back up to 8;000 feet and continued to vector us for the approach. An uneventful approach and landing ensued. The communication problem happened due to ATC being extremely busy handling aircraft with the runway change and inclement weather.The only issue was a lack of communication from ATC as to an altitude clearance when they switched the runway assignment. The runway change effectively changed the lowest altitude limit on the arrival from 8;000 feet to 6;000 feet. ATC could have informed us to maintain 8;000 vice the 6;000 limit on the 23 transition of the arrival. The Air Crew could have queried ATC about whether they still wanted us to descend via the arrival for the different runway. The Air Crew didn't get a chance to query ATC about the clearance due to how busy ATC was on the radio during the runway change.",,"B737-700 flight crew reports being cleared to descend via the BLOGS1 RNAV Arrival; Runway 5 transition.

I believe that there is a serious risk to safety. Flight Crews and Ground Control are continually stepping on each other. Ground Control at MDW typically takes the handoff from Tower after aircraft clear the active runway. The critical aspect of taxiing at MDW is the multiple runways that need to be crossed to get to the terminal. I personally feel that it is just a matter of time before a clearance is misunderstood; or not heard; that could lead to bigger problems.  I further feel that if Ground had to make a split second radio call; it might not ever make it to the intended receiver. I suggest that MDW adopt a comm plan similar to BOS where Air Crew contacts CD when ready to push with gate number.  CD advises Air Crew to 'monitor ground freq.'  CD advises Ground Controller (through their channels) and thus reduces the comm jamming problem.  I realize this is just a problem at certain times of the day; but it's been going on long enough; it needs to be addressed",,,,"Air Carrier pilot reports Ground control frequency congestion at certain times of the day at MDW and suggests a BOS style program to contact Clearance Delivery when ready to push and then monitor Ground for taxi instructions.",

The First Officer (FO) did a very thorough Clearance and Departure briefing.  He was to be the Pilot Flying (PF) for this leg.  He said we would set 7;000 feet in the MCP to comply with the 5;000-7;000 feet restriction at ARILE until we had the aircraft in VNAV.  We had LNAV armed prior to takeoff and he got the airplane on autopilot and autothrottle shortly after the aircraft was cleaned up and selected VNAV.  After coordination with him; I set 10;000 feet in the MCP which is the maintain altitude for the departure.  Everything went as briefed to include checking in with Departure.  About 2.5 miles prior to ARILE and around 6;500 feet with a rapid climb; Departure Control gave us a clearance to 'climb via the SID except maintain 17;000.' I saw the FO's left hand start to move up toward the MCP.  As I was saying; 'don't push that;' he had pushed the ALT INTV button.  With our rapid climb rate; I took control of the aircraft; and disconnected the autopilot and autothrottle to minimize overshoot of the 7;000-foot restriction.  We had a significant overshoot and got up to about 7;400 feet before the climb stopped. Once things settled down; we covered what had gone wrong; basically a breakdown in CRM.  The FO thought the Departure Control instructions meant to climb unrestricted to 17;000 feet and realized he had deleted the ARILE restriction in haste.  He also said he was having difficulty grasping inflight changes to 'Climb Via' clearances.  While this was a breakdown in Crew coordination; the additive condition of a clearance change so near an action point contributed to our error. We debriefed the importance of proper verification before changing any vertical or navigation programming.  Today we will review the 'Climb Via' clearance changes in some depth.  They can be confusing and are often less clear than 'Descend Via' clearances.  Often the pilot monitoring can be the tie breaker.",,"I was Pilot Flying (PF); Captain was Pilot Monitoring (PM). In the Departure brief; I discussed altitude restriction of 5;000-7;000 feet crossing ARILE waypoint while climbing to 10;000 feet in accordance with the 'climb via SID' clearance. MCP altitude was set to 7;000 feet for departure in order to ensure compliance. I briefed plan to reset MCP to 10;000 feet after ensuring VNAV was active mode and that the 7;000 feet restriction at ARILE would be met. Takeoff and initial climb proceeded normally. After the autopilot was engaged; and the aircraft was verified in VNAV; 10;000 feet was set in the MCP altitude window in accordance with the SID climb clearance. As the aircraft began to level at 7;000 feet; approximately three NM prior to ARILE waypoint; ATC (Regional Departure); issued a further clearance to 'climb via the SNSET 1 except maintain 17;000 feet.' I mistakenly interpreted the ATC instructions as continue climb to 17;000 feet. I inserted 17;000 feet in the MCP window; and without pausing to think or review the exact instructions; or verify the instructions with the PM; I pushed the Altitude Intervention button on the MCP. The aircraft immediately began to climb out of 7;000 feet; approximately two to two and one-half NM prior to ARILE.The Captain; as pilot monitoring (PM); immediately recognized the error. He called for control of the aircraft and disengaged the autopilot and autothrottles and leveled; and then descended back to 7;000 feet. We reached a maximum altitude of 7;500 feet. As the Captain took control of the aircraft; I realized the error I had made; and my misunderstanding/misinterpretation of the climb instructions from ATC. It was a mistake that could have easily been avoided by simply dialing in the new clearance altitude of 17;000 feet and not pressing Altitude Intervention. Instead of rushing; I could have used better Crew Coordination and taken a moment to verify with the Captain that we both agreed what the ATC climb instructions were; and that we agreed with regards to the correct action to comply with those instructions from ATC.ATC; did not express concern or query us about our brief altitude deviation. After leveling back at 7;000 feet and past ARILE waypoint; the Captain verified our climb clearance with ATC and we proceeded to climb via the SID to 17;000 feet. Do not rush. Use better Crew Coordination and verify an action with fellow Crew Member; PM; before executing the action. Pay better attention to departure climb instructions. Do not get complacent or assume that a further climb instruction is an unrestricted climb just because that is what ATC usually gives us or that is what they gave me last time.",,"B737 flight crew on the SNSET 1 RNAV departure; with the First Officer flying; describes missing a crossing restriction after being assigned a new top altitude by ATC and pushing the altitude intervention button on the MCP instead of just setting the new altitude.

We were quite reluctant to take the aircraft; but after a lengthy discussion the mechanics; we were cautiously optimistic that they were correct and that by pulling both Brake Fan CBs that no power was going to that area.

When we did so; the BLEED 1 OFF; BLEED 2 OFF; and WING STAB INHIBIT CAS messages illuminated; and we immediately began to lose cabin pressure at approximately 2;500 feet per minute. Since we were already at 5;000 feet and descending we did not perform any memory items for loss of pressurization; but we did run the associated QRH for the CAS messages. After turning the bleed selector switches to OFF and waiting 1 minute; we turned them back to auto; and cabin pressurization was restored. Upon landing we notified maintenance. When we returned to the aircraft after it was returned to service; we noticed that the maintenance sign-off indicated that they had ops-checked the pneumatic system and then returned the aircraft to service. We called maintenance because this concerned us; and we were told that there is a known condition in the Phenom that will cause a loss of pressurization if the wing anti-ice is selected on. Embraer has a Fleet Operations Letter (FOL) describing this condition; and the letter allows for the condition and says that no maintenance action is required; and that no discrepancy should be noted upon landing if the condition occurs in flight. The maintenance department and Duty Manager referenced this letter as a reason why no repairs were made. I was told over the phone that there is a permanent fix for this issue; but that they hadn't gotten around to fixing all the aircraft yet. I'm very surprised that Embraer and our company would consider ANY known condition that causes a total pressurization failure to be acceptable to continue to operate the aircraft with. I'd suggest that we install the permanent fix as soon as possible; and ground any Phenom's that don't have it installed in the meantime. I would also suggest that the company make its flight crews aware of the existence of this condition and what triggers it (anti-ice selected on with thrust levers at idle below 13;000 feet; according to the FOL). To my knowledge; neither this condition nor the FOL are available anywhere to the crews.

We were told that this is a known problem with the Phenom and that Embraer has issued a Fleet Operations Letter (FOL) which allows us to fly with this known problem. The FOL states that investigation of this problem was limited to turning on the anti-ice with the thrust levers at idle; below 13;000 feet. The FOL recommends leaving the thrust levers above idle when selecting the anti-ice on below 13;000 feet. Since it is a known problem; the ideal solution would be to fix it. I am not confident that this problem only exists below 13;000 feet and would not want to experience a cabin depressurization at higher altitudes.",,"EMB505 flight crew experiences a dual bleed trip when the engine and wing anti ice systems are turned on descending through 5;000 feet.

I took pictures of the mess and emailed them to maintenance. I wrote up the aircraft as directed by maintenance as an AOG [Aircraft on Ground] item with an oil leak.[The next day] I went back out to the aircraft to do a ferry flight then a revenue trip. We noticed that the access door where you control the main cabin outside door switch was open and swinging in the breeze along with no red/blue security sticker on the baggage door. We called security and finally found out that the mechanics that said they could not find an oil leak left the panel open and did not sticker the baggage door. But....the Belly of the aircraft was all cleaned up (no oil leaks) and signed off as no leaks found on the APU. We fired up the APU and proceeded to prepare the aircraft for flight. After about 10 minutes my first officer came up to me after loading crew bags and said there was oil leaking out of panels around the APU. I shut down the APU; took pictures and emailed them to maintenance. At this time the mechanic that inspected the aircraft the day before came out of nowhere up the stairs and asked 'what's the problem' we told him about the oil and went back to show him the new leakage. When we got back to the aft belly area the oil was ALL WIPED UP! He said he had just wiped it up. I told him the aircraft was leaking again and he said it was just residue oil from someone previously filling/spillage the APU with oil. I asked him why this 'residue oil' didn't leak out during last night but started leaking again after we started the APU. He looked at me like I was stupid. I; myself; since 1984 have kept current my Airframe and Powerplant mechanic's license along with my FAA Inspection Authorization and know when an aircraft is leaking! We MEL'd the APU; got a huffer; started the main engines and ferried to [our interim destination]. I followed the maintenance line on this aircraft and sure enough some lines; elbows and hoses were ordered for the APU oil leak repair.The suggestions I have are: #1: Not to let inexperienced mechanics touch a Gulfstream G550 (it impacted an owners trip) #2: Do we or do we not investigate the experience level of these mechanics as to which aircraft they have experience on? #3: Is this so called mechanic a 'jack of all trades' working on all of our aircraft with very little experience on any of them? #4: Was THIS mechanic ever at a Gulfstream factory maintenance initial or recurrent [training session]? I don't think anyone can 'save money' with cheap mechanics; this is proven history in the aviation business. #5 Let us not forget that we can't run these Gulfstream APU's in flight because the sealant around its enclosure isn't fireproof and can you imagine if we get an APU fire going in the aft compartment? #6: My grandfather taught me two things: 1: A lazy man does the most work. 2: If you get too greedy you get caught.",,,,"A G500 Captain took exception to the attempt by a Mechanic to insist a twice 'wiped' APU oil leak was merely the result of overfilling.

When I started preflighting Aircraft X; right away I could see the damage on the bracket that attaches to the Nose Gear Strut.  I have already written two company reports on this and have seen this on Aircraft Y in ZZZ three days earlier and another pilot wrote it up on Aircraft Z; another Hawker-800; the same day when I told him about our airplane having this issue. Now on Aircraft X; this time the bracket wasn't completely cracked around the relief hole for the grease zerk like the others; but was instead bent and had the paint worn off and what appeared to be a stress crack on it. It appeared that the bracket had shifted slightly around the strut and on one portion of the relief hole; it had bent around the strut by the zerk [grease fitting].To confirm this I went over to look at both Aircraft Y and Z where a few days prior a new bracket was installed on the strut. On both of these two airplanes; that relief hole around the grease zerk was not bent but straight and set right over the grease zerk and not cocked to one side and bent like on Aircraft X. Now the thing that bothered me was that this airplane had been preflighted three days earlier by two [Flight Test] pilots and I had told these two about the bracket being cracked on Aircraft Y and how [is it] they couldn't see it bent like this; especially after I pointed it out on another plane; [had] surprised me. Either way I wrote this item up. The other issue we had with this airplane [Aircraft X] is that when we tested the toilet; it wouldn't flush. There was no sound of the motor running but we had power in the lavatory and no CB's were out. So even if we hadn't had the Nose Gear Strut bracket issue; there was no [way] we could have done our passenger leg after our ferry to ZZZ1; as we were flying cross country. Or if we did; we would have to stop one or two times at least for myself as my bladder could never make this long of a flight. I am sure this would not have pleased the owners. We also had a couple of other minor MEL issues and addressed these too. Now I point this issue out as this is the 5th time I have written up an airplane over this [nose gear bracket] in the last few months. I feel there is something causing this problem but either way it needs to be addressed by maintenance when we are at a service center. I have been told they have a list of items they check and this should be one of them.","Reporter stated the bracket causing all the turmoil is attached to the upper (outer) nose gear strut housing; the female section of the nose gear. That bracket supports an important squat switch for the wing landing lights and is an option on Hawker aircraft with a three position switch in the cockpit that actually shows 'Auto' and 'Off'. In the Auto mode; the very hot landing lights in both wings should turn off on landing when the nose gear squat switch is depressed and turn on the four Taxi lights in the nose cone. If the Squat switch does not function on landing; the wing landing lights will overtemp due to lack of airflow and cause serious damage to the wing area.Reporter stated the same bracket also has a hole cut into the bracket for a Zerk fitting on the nose gear strut to protrude through the hole and allow Maintenance access to the Zerk fitting in order to grease the strut. Cracks have developed on the bracket edge and near the Zerk fitting hole that are not deferrable; cannot be MEL'd; even though the bracket is structurally sound where it is attached to the strut. So writing up the bracket becomes a real issue for an aircraft in high demand. Hawker has transferred all issues with the aircraft to third party OEM Vendors for Operators looking to get any relief; which takes forever. Getting documentation or revisions for MELs from the OEMs is very difficult. The Hawker-900s use LED lights and do not have the wing heat concerns that earlier model Hawkers have had.",,,"A pilot reports about cracks that develop in a bracket attached to the Nose Landing Gear (NLG) strut that are not deferrable on Hawker HS-125-800 XP aircraft; causing delays and cancellations.

The person I spoke with at MCC said to write it up. After about 20 minutes I received a phone call from whom I believe was Mr. X in maintenance; He said he wanted to get more info about the write up. I explained that the yoke was loose on the shaft; he commented that he wondered if I could have written it up at a 'better' airport where there was a maintenance operation and this would open up a 'real can of worms' here at ZZZ and we would probably have to get Gulfstream involved on this write up. I could not believe what I was hearing. I explained that the yoke was loose on its shaft and needed to be fixed before the next takeoff. I watched the progression of the aircraft and saw that a nut was loose on the shaft and a mechanic torqued it back up to fix the problem. On another note; about 2 months ago I flew a G550 into ZZZ1 that had about 1 inch of hysteresis play on the elevator control column before desired movement was felt with the elevators. I wrote this aircraft up for this concern. The next day I received a text message from a Duty Manager stating he was curious what the 'parameters for preflight check on a control check was?' I texted back that it's freedom of movement and controls move in the proper direction which the aircraft had... THEN: I followed this write up and the maintenance personnel found a bushing laying on a cheek panel that goes into the elevator control system was not put back in when they themselves changed out elevator control cables 3 WEEKS PRIOR! (They put the bushing back into the elevator system) I believe the aircraft had about 40 flights on it since the elevator cable change. I noticed it on my first flight with the airplane. This hysteresis of this type cannot be felt with the aircraft static on the ground and the gravity on the elevators; only when the elevators get 'air loaded' does any play or slop show up in the controls. This aircraft also had an operational check flight 'signed off' after the elevator cables were changed. 1) I wonder if the mechanic that 'torqued' the nut back on the loose control yoke used a 'torque wrench' to the specified poundage in the GMM? I should not have to 'defend' my write ups with Mr. X at maintenance.(2) I think I was texted from the Duty Manager about the elevator hysteresis as he was questioning why I wrote up the airplane for this. (Same feeling from the phone call from maintenance about the control yoke issue)(3) Since 1984; I have had my Airframe [and] Powerplant mechanics license and Inspection Authorization from the FAA; have hand built over 6 homebuilt experimental aircraft myself and know a little bit about control systems. (4) Why weren't these items caught at the RII level or routine inspections?(5) Elevator systems are critical; never take them for GRANTED!

Shortly after takeoff; climbing through approx. 500 feet AGL; the engine monitor alarm indicated a high and rapidly rising Cylinder Head Temperature (CHT). Suspecting detonation/pre-ignition; power was reduced to minimum needed for level flight and a left turn to enter a downwind for runway 27 was started. At this point I noticed a hot/burning smell. A tight pattern was flown and the aircraft promptly landed. Exiting the aircraft; smoke was seen rising from the engine cowling near the air inlet. This was extinguished with a fire extinguisher and the cowling removed. The inside of the cowling was visibly damaged due to melting/extreme heating from what appeared to be the exhaust manifold. Post inspection revealed that the exhaust system had been improperly assembled. The exhaust manifold from the cylinders was not fully fitted into the slip joint of the exhaust Y-tube transition pipe. It was approximately one inch out of place. This reduced the clearance between the exhaust and cowling causing the melting and smoking. Additionally; because the manifold was out of place; there was a small gap between the cylinder head and the exhaust manifold flanges. Exhaust leaks from this area potentially caused the high CHT indication. In the future; a much more in-depth post maintenance inspection is necessary to prevent a recurrence.","Reporter stated the exhaust manifold was previously sent out for repair after a small hole was noticed in the manifold during an Annual Inspection. When mechanics reinstalled the exhaust manifold they were apparently hoping the attaching nuts would help pull-in and seat the manifold against the engine. But that did not happen. Instead; the small gap that still existed between the exhaust manifold and the engine allowed hot gases to blow near the Cylinder Head Temperature (CHT) sensor causing a high temp indication. The smoke and heat damage to the engine cowling was caused by the same exhaust manifold not being properly fitted into the slip joint of the exhaust Y-tube transition pipe.",,,"A single pilot reports that on the first flight after Maintenance repaired the Exhaust System on their Mooney M20K-305 aircraft; they noticed a hot/burning smell and the engine monitor alarm indicated a high and rapidly rising Cylinder Head Temperature (CHT).

The tower at CXO was closed at the time and the aircraft behind us could not be cleared for the approach until we cancelled IFR. I also believe the Captain may have been a confused about the conditions under which we could cancel IFR. In this case the visibility was good but the ceiling too low. However; I verbally intervened but was more focused on flying the airplane. As a result I was left in the compromised position of either talking to him; talking on the radio or flying the aircraft.

Once we were cleared to descend; we were very high; and had a 20 to 30 knot tailwind; as we were attempting to join the ILS to Runway 16R. The visibility was reported at six NM; but the actual visibility was more like three or four NM. The combination of these factors did not permit us to establish a stabilized approach by 1;000 AGL; and I initiated a go-around. When NorCal Approach vectored us back for another ILS Approach; they turned us to intercept the LOC to Runway 16R just outside of FAPIN; which is only two NM outside of the final approach fix. I had been very busy reconfiguring our FMC for the next approach; and the First Officer (FO); new to the 737; had chosen to hand fly the aircraft with the flight director turned off; and subsequently overshot the LOC by a small margin. As I was focused on helping him re-intercept the LOC; Approach called to ask if we were intercepting the LOC; and I confirmed that we were. They may have told us at that time to contact Capital Tower; but I was preoccupied with helping the FO to intercept the course and glideslope; and getting him to slow the aircraft to the required flap extension speeds. The tailwind was approximately 22 knots at this point; which was again complicating the situation. With his unfamiliarity with the 737; (which slows down less rapidly than his previous aircraft; a older McDonnell Douglas aircraft); he was trying to stay on the glideslope; but was not able to slow below the max speed for extending the flaps to 25 and 30. I told him to reduce his descent rate to allow the aircraft to slow to flap extension speeds; which caused us to get high on glideslope. This resulted in our attention being focused on re-establishing a stabilized approach; although we did have the runway in sight. We did finally achieve a stabilized approach; but we were below 1;000 AGL. I seriously considered executing another go-around; but decided; against my better judgment; that doing a second go-around would unnecessarily alarm the Passengers; when the situation was coming under control. After reflection; I also realized that there was the 'embarrassment factor' if we were not able to complete the second approach. After a safe landing; when we contacted Ground Control; as we turned off the runway; they asked if we had received clearance to land from Tower. It was at that point that we realized I had failed to set Tower frequency in the radio; and had been too busy to remember that we had not received landing clearance. I asked the Ground Controller for more information to ascertain that there had not been any traffic conflict that had been caused by the radio issue. They assured me that there was no conflict; and after I asked a few more questions; they gave me their phone number. When I called the Controller the first time; he again stated that there had been no traffic conflict; but that a Company aircraft waiting for takeoff had declined the clearance to 'line up and wait' because of the radio issue; preferring to wait until we had landed. The Controller also stated that after Tower had been unable to contact us; they had asked Approach to call us; but neither of us heard Approach call; so we don't know if they actually did attempt to call us. (Thinking back on the event; it's possible that I may have started to dial in the Tower frequency; then got distracted by the FO's difficulties; and may have ended up with a non-functioning frequency set in our radio.) In our second of two conversations; the Controller told me that for the last two days there had been an unusually high number of go-arounds that had been caused by the tailwinds on final approach; including at least two from earlier in the same day as our flight; and one after.I should have initiated a go-around on the second approach; and disregarded my concerns about Passenger perceptions and personal pride. Our landing was safe; but the approach was out of our normal Company parameters; and that; in itself; was enough reason to go-around again. On the second approach; I should have taken the aircraft and either corrected back to course and speed myself; rather than possibly overwhelming the FO with all the instructions and guidance I was trying to give him. I should have thought to request a longer downwind; because of the tailwinds and reduced visibility; because I realized later that the Approach Controller was probably giving us turns based on normal wind and visibility conditions. The short turn to final set us up for another rushed approach; which further complicated the already non-standard circumstance of returning for a second landing after the go-around. I should have told the FO to put the autopilot and flight director back on; and back me up with reconfiguring the aircraft systems and computers for the next approach. If both of us had been focusing on that; we could have more adequately covered all the bases and reviewed all the extenuating circumstances such as the tailwind and the decreased visibility; and cross-checked the FMC for correct reprogramming of the ILS Approach. I felt that I learned valuable lessons in Crew management from this event. I will never again allow another Pilot's lack of experience put us into a situation that could diminish the margin of safety of a flight. He and I thoroughly debriefed all the circumstances surrounding this flight; and I believe that he will be better prepared to recognize the situation he was in; much earlier in the approach; and take the necessary and appropriate actions to establish a stabilized approach much earlier than he did on this flight.",,"I thought everything was under control and was monitoring our distance from JARNU (the FAF) and FAPIN (two miles from JARNU) which were clearly displayed on my NAV display. NorCal turned us on base approximately two miles from FAPIN and then subsequently cleared us for the approach. I requested VOR/LOC and was monitoring the Localizer and glideslope manual data. When I glanced at my FMA; I expected to see 'VOR/LOC' there like we usually get and was slow to realize that since my flight director was off; blank was normal. It was at this point that I overshot the Localizer and got high on the glideslope. As I was making corrections back to both Localizer and glideslope; the Captain was trying to assist me with configuring.",,"A B737-700 flight crew found themselves high and fast due to a high and late turn to final and significant tailwinds.

He was between 300 feet and 400 feet out from the gate. It looked like he was in position to clear my wingtip from a baggage tug that appeared to have stalled in the middle of the ramp. Later; I asked a Ramp Supervisor if it was an inoperative tug way out on the ramp. He told me it was a new airport policy to require a Wing Walker out there. Even on this clear night; it was hard to notice him or understand why he was there. I could easily have missed him if he hadn't parked his vehicle (the tug) behind him. On a cloudy; rainy night I can imagine a scenario where the Pilots would be searching for the lead in line; or concentrating on another aircraft in their area and completely miss the Marshaler.During pushback; he was in the same position and I noticed he was guarding a service road that crosses the ramp. I felt it was unsafe for anyone to be standing so far out on the ramp in an area where we would never expect to see a Wing Walker/Marshaler. There is nothing about this policy in the SFO 10-7 pages. Personnel/Wing Walkers are expected near the ends of the safety zone; but not way out on the ramp. Company should present safety concern regarding this to airport and consider alternatives for the gates in this area.

The visual was backed up with the ILS approach for guidance while on the arrival. We were vectored off of the arrival for traffic avoidance and then vectored toward the field for a visual approach. We were about seven miles away from the field on a base leg a 5;000 FT AGL. When we were cleared for the visual approach to Runway 26. I thought we were a little high and close and in retrospect should have widened the approach out a little and configured more slowly and flown the approach profile closer to a 3.0 degree approach than was possible from our current position. I maintained altitude while disengaging the autopilot and auto-throttles and configured the plane for landing in an effort to increase drag and manage our descent more effectively for a landing. The approach maintained a steady rate of descent and configuration; but could not be considered a stabilized approach per the FOM. The approach was performed with the thrust levers at flight idle in order to reach the field in the touch down zone. While in the flare to land over the runway; normal configuration; I was attempting to effect a soft touch down; as well as landing in the touch down zone and in the process of the flare the stick shaker was activated as we touched the runway. The first officer called out a low speed warning as we touched down and the shaker was activated. Other than the slow speed and stick shaker event the touch down was uneventful.

In an effort to get the flight off the gate close to scheduled departure time; I decided to start filling out the ACARS back-up form. Once the bridge was moved off of the aircraft; the ACARS reconnected and the First Officer quickly grabbed the paperwork (CLR and passenger load information) and entered it in an effort to receive takeoff data before the ACARS could possibly lose connection again.We received our data; programmed it and closed the door for departure. We verified the takeoff data was set; accomplished all normal checklists and were cleared for takeoff. I called; 'V1; Rotate' as indicated by the speed bugs and the FO pulled back on the yoke. When the wheels left the ground; I felt what seemed like the tail sinking down. The FO slowed his rotation and the aircraft began to climb. During climb; I observed the low-speed warning tape on the bottom of the airspeed indicator. Normally; it is not visible. I believe the FO noticed this also and adjusted pitch to allow the aircraft to fly at a higher speed. After 10000 FT; we talked about it and he described how he had noticed the green line on the airspeed tape. I talked about the low-speed tape. The FO described how he allowed the aircraft to climb at a higher speed because of his realization of the speed issue. As we investigated the speeds and realized they were set at the correct speeds from the ACARS; we noticed that the passenger loadout was incorrect. The correct loading was: 12 in zone 1; 31 in zone 2 and 31 in zone 3. What was entered into the ACARS was 12 in zone 1; 11 in zone 2 and 11 in zone 3 - FORTY passengers less than were actually aboard. We calculated that the aircraft was almost 8000 lbs heavier than the v-speeds that were set.We manually calculated a correct weight for landing and entered this into the landing-data request to provide accurate landing speeds.The desire to get the flight going.

In addition; as a crew; we were asked continually to move the plane illegally as were about 6-10 other crew members.On the day in question myself and another pilot were airlined downed to [the airport] to bring an aircraft back [to the U.S. mainland] with the gear down. The airplane had been written up by another crew for failure of the gear to retract during takeoff. Mechanics were sent down there to do ONLY a pre-ferry inspection. No repairs for the problem. They attempted to get Management to send jacks down or acquire jacks on location; but they were told to just do the basic inspection and not to swing the gear or other normal inspections for this anomaly.[The manual] from the beginning of the maintenance issue on this plane was violated and disregarded. [The manual] is only in effect when the airplane must be moved with the gear down for maintenance purposes only. In addition; our Company does include a self issued ferry permit. Unlike a situation where an MEL has expired and the Ferry Permit can override some things and allow you to fly it to a maintenance base; [the manual] is not the same. It has very specific guidelines that are not waiveable and must be followed. The Following items were violated in [the manual]:1. At company direction; the 2 mechanics that were sent down there; were added to the Ferry permit. Ferry Permits and [the manual] BOTH clearly state that NO passengers are allowed. Only Essential Crew are allowed on board. 2. A wet footprint was on this flight although our company never operates a flight where a wet footprint occurs. In [the manual]; it clearly states that glide distance with gear down is 15nm/10000ft of altitude. Due to freezing levels forecasted to be at and above 16k; the best glide distance we could have had was 20nm. There were multiple areas on that flight where we were beyond 20nm from land. 3. [The manual] states that a takeoff from an aerodrome where the likelihood of ditching may occur; takeoff is prohibited. Obviously; [this airport] is an island in the middle of the ocean. The initial conversation on the phone with our Chief Pilot that I had was not good. When I questioned how we were supposed to comply with [the manual]; he said they had determined that if we had an issue; we could bring up the gear. I stated that that would be impossible because there was not any maintenance done on the plane and the original write-up was that the gear would not retract. He stated he would have to get back to me. He then called me back about 30 minutes later stating [he had been advised] that we could takeoff because we were on a Special Ferry Permit. I asked to speak to the Duty Officer directly. He said he would have him call. About another 30 minutes went by and instead of a phone call I received an email from the Duty Officer. The email basically said that this email was my express approval to operate under Special Ferry Permit overwater with the gear down. I emailed him back and said that I would like to talk to him. I called him when he sent me his number. I tried explaining why this flight could not and should not happen. I was told that I should get in the plane and do the job I was being paid to do. I then respectfully declined to do the trip. At that point after my conversation was done; my copilot was called to see if they made him the PIC would he fly the plane back He respectfully declined. In addition; another crew was asked to fly the aircraft as well. They declined also. All told; there were about 6-10 pilots/crews called to take the trip. One crew finally accepted and flew it back to [the mainland] a few days later. In conclusion; these extended over water operations need to cease unless [the manual] in its entirety can be complied with. These long over water flights are dangerous and more complex than what they appear. Ourdispatch can't even plan a trip with any certainty of fuel burn etc. [the manual] states at best; fuel burn will be 75% more burn beyond what a flight would burn at .75 mach. Should a crew be assigned this type of flight and not fully realize what they are getting into it could be disastrous for the Company and that crew. As stated in the report; [the manual] must be complied with for future Gear down ferries where flying over water is concerned. Putting an aircraft on a Ferry Permit and or Special Ferry Permit does not override this section.",,,,"Several flight crews refused to conduct a gear down; overwater ferry as doing so would violate provisions for conduct of such flight.

At the time DFW was landing south. Before leaving a ROUTE-LEGS check was accomplished including all the airspeeds and altitudes on the BRDJE 1 ARRIVAL. Descending into DFW and after departing SEEVR; the Controller called and asked us to verify that we were on the SEEVR arrival and I looked down at the PDC and told the First Officer to respond that our clearance was on the BRDJE arrival. The Controller then issued instructions to descend to 12;000 feet as quickly as possible and started giving vectors in order to get us down and in sequence to land on Runway 17C. After talking through this with the First Officer; we realized another controller had told us previously when we were in the descent; that after SEEVR; to fly the SEEVR 1. We looked down at the NAV display and saw that we were heading to SEEVR and wondered why the controller would say that. I wondered if the controller wanted us to descend via the arrival. So the First Officer queried the controller and asked if he wanted us to descend via and he said no; just fly the SEEVR ARRIVAL. Seeing the SEEVR fix on the display; it did not register to either me or the FO that the controller was; in fact; changing the arrival.I realize that we did not get the message that the controller was changing the arrival from the BRDJE 1 to the SEEVR 1. Because the route-legs check had been accomplished back before we left we did not notice that it was a Landing North arrival when DFW was landing south. But having said that; this problem started all the way back before we even left the gate.First: We were filed on the BRDJE1 when DFW was landing south. We have seen on so many flights where the dispatcher has filed us on one arrival landing one direction when we know the airport is landing the other direction. Enroute; we hear other flights talking to FT Worth Center trying to change the arrival enroute and they're told to wait until they get to DFW. Second: We did everything we could to ensure the filed routing was correct in the FMS; including doing an airspeed and altitude check on every fix of the arrival into DFW. Most of the time I tell the First Officer that we will check all of those points sometime prior to the actual arrival about 45 minutes to an hour away. That would have more likely allowed us to catch this error. Third: The SEEVR 1 and the BRDJE 1 both have the SEEVR and BRDJE fixes which from a human factors perspective is just asking for trouble. I think this is an issue that needs to be changed. Fourth: If the controller had said; 'This is a change from the BRDJE 1 to the SEEVR 1' we would have more clearly realized what the controller was trying to say. Finally: If we would have taken a closer look at what the controller said to us approaching SEEVR we may have caught this error. But we did already realize that what the controller had said was slightly odd and we queried if he wanted us to descend via and he said no. We are constantly striving to be extremely vigilant on these new arrivals. Both the First Officer and I expressed a desire to not be someone who made an error and despite our best efforts; we just did not catch this. The controller was great and very quick to remedy the situation and get us back where we needed to be.",,"Both the Captain and I are very careful and conscientious people. We had spoken earlier about some human factors classes at the schoolhouse and how some things ATC says should be RED FLAGS for your present situation. When ATC assigned me an arrival I was 'already on' I thought he meant altitude. That was my RED FLAG that ATC was assigning us a change. I missed it. DARN IT!If ATC would say the words 'Change to your arrival routing' I would have caught on or better yet PLEASE stop using the same intersection names on these arrivals. That has thrown me off several times when trying to pull up an arrival in my iPad that has a fix named the same as another arrival.

After determining that the clearance was in fact for us a go around was initiated with the autopilot at first on and then disconnected; the turn to H140 was slow and altitude of 3;000 FT over shot by 550 FT.The clearance caused some level of confusion and delay since 'go around or discontinue approach' phraseology was not used by the controller.

It was indicating they were using VOR/DME 8R. We briefed this approach and set up for it. This was also the approach we had been planned by dispatch.When we checked in with the next controller we were given ILS 26L. We had plenty of time to set it up and brief it. We also briefed that it would be visual since we already had the airport insight. The FO was the flying pilot and the captain was conducting new hire IOE. We were cleared for the ILS 26L approach by the controller and then asked shortly after when we had picked up the airport. We estimated it was at least 8000 ft.At approx 6000 ft the FO clicked off the autopilot and was hand flying the aircraft on the visual approach. He called for flaps on speed and I was stetting the flaps and approach speeds; as well as the gear down before landing check. We were handed off to tower and cleared to land 26L. Approx 1000 ft I noticed that the FO didn't have his ILS freq in the active and I reached over to put it in for him. My attention was temporarily deviated as he was a little high and I was coaching him on speed and altitude. At 500 ft he called 500 to go.

Not restful sleep; as I am 6'5'; trying to sleep in a seat versus a bunk. In particular; the footrest is inadequate for someone my size; and I can't properly elevate my legs during sleep. Arrived in RJAA in the morning; tired despite two naps. Took a brief nap after arrival; and after lunch; got a long sleep in; but not at the time I had wanted it. Woke up at 9 pm local. Awake until noon the next day; slept 4 hours until wake-up. Felt rested but knew I would need a nap enroute. Both other crew members advised that they were fully rested; so I elected to take first break. It is extremely challenging to get good rest on board the airplane; due to the complete lack of a crew rest area; but we do the best we can. Had to request fresh blankets/pillows prior to departure as they had not been provided - this should be part of the pre-departure servicing on any long-haul flight. At cruise; I did my best to create an adequate sleep environment; as the company has done nothing to improve the facilities on this plane in the two years it's been in service. This requires pulling out all three jumpseats; shoving meal trays between the seats and filling the gaps with extra blankets/pillows to create somewhat of a lie-flat surface (another reason to provide us with more blankets/pillows). Had a good nap but could've used more sleep. Captain woke me up to take his rest period. Swapping out involves crew members jumping over the extended jumpseats to get to the lav (which is blocked when someone is sleeping; and we would prefer not to wake a sleeping crew member but on occasion have no choice). It's also difficult to access the galley freely when someone is sleeping; and as a result; crews wait longer than they would normally to use the bathroom or get a meal; as we know how critical a rest period can be. I took over for the captain and had to dodge thunderstorms at night over the equator; as well as deal with poor communications. CPDLC was terminated south of Guam and we were unable to contact Port Moresby by HF or VHF for a considerable amount of time; likely due to the electrical activity of the storms in our path. Once the captain woke up; the other First Officer (FO) took his place and I took his seat. I noticed toward the end of the flight; I was yawning and beginning to feel drowsy. The sun was coming up but fortunately at this point; workload was light. The other FO resumed his duties prior to descent and we landed normally. It's worth noting that both the captain and other FO both reported being fully rested; having good sleep immediately prior to wake-up; and yet the both needed naps to complete the flight. The lack of a crew rest area on this airplane is totally unacceptable for the type of flying it's currently doing. A 10-hour; overwater; ETOPS flight; at night; typically with challenging thunderstorm activity mid-flight; combined with poor communication with ATC; requires that we all be at the top of our game. Too many things can go wrong with 'rest' enroute - we're not separated from the cockpit in any way; and while trying to sleep; we often block access to the lavatory or the galley; which impacts the full alertness of the operating crew. I've written a fatigue report on this airplane before. It remains open because the company is 'studying options' for crew rest. The airplane has been in service for two years now. How about we try something besides the configuration it's been in since we took delivery?",,,,"A B767-300ER First Officer addressed the continued problem of inadequate flight crew rest facilities on his company's fleet.",

Preflight; startup; runup were uneventful. I was cleared...as filed. Sometime after arriving at cruise altitude the intercom clicked off-and-on a couple of times; then went silent. I tried adjusting some of the panel settings; reconnecting headsets; and general troubleshooting. It became clear the intercom would not function. Thinking the panel had reverted to failsafe mode with Comm 1 in operation; I then attempted to call ATC to notify them of the issue. I ascertained that all other aspects of the flight were normal and all other mechanical/electronic functions were unimpaired. I checked the on-board Garmin manual and verified my procedures and that the audio panel should have reverted to Comm 1 being functional. I was [however] unsuccessful in raising ATC. I tried switching radios and settings several times. I ran the abnormal checklist for failed communications on the SR-22; including cycling the audio panel circuit-breaker. At that point I realized I was completely NORDO and squawked 7600. I also transmitted on what I thought would be the nearest airport approach frequency and on 121.5 that I was NORDO; that all other aspects of flight were normal. I had the sense that I was being heard: the Tx indicator lit up when I keyed the mike; and shortly thereafter the Rx indicator would light up as though someone was trying to respond; but audio never returned. I reviewed in my head and verified on the reminder sheet I carry on my kneeboard the proper NORDO procedure for IFR flight. I did what I thought was correct; maintaining the highest altitude of cleared; expected; MEA. Since I was cleared all the way to [destination] I reasoned that I would maintain 7;000 till arriving; descend and look for light signals. In that regard; I reviewed the light signals procedures on my kneeboard sheet. I reported on 121.5 passing over IFM in case anyone could hear; and that the flight conditions otherwise remained normal. I continuously scanned visually for traffic and monitored my MFD for traffic as well. I detected no conflicts. As I got closer to [our destination] I attempted to text-message my CFII and CSIP to apprise them of the situation and to get phone numbers for approach and/or the control tower. Cell reception was spotty; but I did eventually get the numbers. It was at that point that I remembered I always carry a portable radio (never had to use it IN the plane in the 4 years I've had it; just used it for getting clearances on the ground). Being preoccupied with flying safely; scanning for traffic; etc.; apparently precluded my remembering about the radio until I was in the actual process of cell-contacting CFII/CSIP. My CFII had notified Approach of my situation. I maintained 7;000 till I was in radio range. I contacted approach and received clearance for a visual approach; switched to tower and landed uneventfully. I utilized my wife to hand the radio back and forth as I dealt with the last phases of flight and landing. At no time did I think the safety of the flight was in jeopardy. After the flight; I reviewed the FAR/AIM for NORDO procedures and now realize that when IFR; IN VMC CONDITIONS; the correct procedure would have been to land as soon as practicable at a suitable airport after going NORDO; rather than continuing the flight all the way to [our destination]; even though I was cleared all the way. I had only recalled and noted the IFR NORDO procedure which was for actual IFR conditions. I have already verified and reviewed these NORDO procedures with both my usual CFII as well as with the Cirrus Standardized Instructor Pilot (CSIP) at my [home airport]. In the future; if this should happen again; I will know to land if in VMC; rather than continue the flight. And I will continue to carry my handheld radio and remember immediately that I have it and use itto try to contact ATC.",,,,"When the pilot of an SR22 on an IFR cross country in VMC lost all communications with ATC he utilized a variety of resources to continue the flight to destination where he and his passenger landed safely.",

Approximately 5 miles east of the field; as we were flying direct to a 3 mile final for runway 31 at PAO; NorCal TRACON terminated radar services and approved us to change frequencies to advisory; since the Palo Alto tower was closed. We changed our squawk code to 1200 and changed frequencies to CTAF; immediately broadcasting our position and intention to enter a 3 mile right base for runway 31. Shortly thereafter; a Bonanza came on frequency and announced a 6 mile final for 31. We broadcast that we were about to turn a 3 mile final approach and the Bonanza agreed that we would be first for the field. While in the turn to final; Moffett tower (NUQ) transmitted on Palo Alto CTAF and stated that Moffett tower was in operation and there were two aircraft in the Moffett class D without coordination. We rolled out on final and landed without incident; but after landing reviewed the San Francisco terminal area chart (TAC) and determined that we (along with the Bonanza) were likely one of the aircraft the tower was referring to. Our approach and arrival profile was not unusual for both IFR (visual) and VFR arrivals into PAO. Having never encountered issues before; we did not review the TAC prior to or in flight for possible airspace conflicts. Additionally; since we had been flying direct to that 3 mile final for over 100 miles and receiving flight following; we mistakenly assumed that ATC would have coordinated for us if necessary or advised us of a conflict ahead in the last 5 miles of the flight. After reviewing the TAC; it became clear that for the 2 hours when Palo Alto tower is closed but Moffett's is open; the only way to enter the pattern for runway 31 from the east without flying through the northwest portion of the NUQ class D is to fly essentially to midfield at PAO and turn a tight base out of the right downwind; as anything past approximately a 1 mile final for 31 is in the NUQ class D. Other options would be to explicitly ask TRACON for coordination; or to call Moffett tower immediately after handoff and request a class D transition. This was a good reminder of the insidious nature of complacency - making a VFR approach into our home field; we were certainly aware of the limits of the SFO class B and SJC class C and briefed the class B altitudes and our speed limits; but once cleared through or clear of both of those; our entire focus was on entering the pattern at PAO; not the adjoining airports. It was a good reminder that even though VFR flight is generally perceived to have fewer restrictions than IFR; it comes with an increased burden of preparation and situational awareness on the pilot's part when it comes to airspace.",,,,"BE90 reported an airspace violation on approach to PAO; citing the unusual airspace structure relative to NUQ as contributing to the event.",

There were many events leading up to a Minimum Fuel Emergency. My original First Officer (FO) called off sick. After a second FO was assigned to the trip we needed to make our way from the terminal to the maintenance hangar. When we arrived at the hangar the aircraft was not ready to fly. During the preflight we found multiple discrepancies. Cracked taxi lights; zero fuel in the left tank; 500 LBS fuel in the right tank. Our oxygen bottle had 130 PSI. The plane was covered with snow and ice. Our original flight plan called for release fuel 7200 with min takeoff fuel 6700. That would allow us 2100 planed arrival fuel. The above discrepancies and the late arrival of fuel put us three hours behind schedule. During this period of time dispatch did an amendment to the release; but failed to inform us of the change. We deiced the plane and departed with 6800 LBS fuel on board. We were calculating fuel throughout the flight. Over our midpoint we calculated we would have enough fuel to land in our destination. To ensure we did not encounter any delays to the airport we declared a minimum fuel emergency with Center. However; Center did not pass on to Approach our emergency. They only informed Approach control we were min fuel. There was a military C130 in the pattern. We were given a vector for traffic which we denied and again informed Approach control of the emergency. At that time the aircraft was vectored away from the runway.

We consulted the QRH which stated there was a fault in the system but that flaps should operate normally. We continued. Gear and flap retraction was all normal after takeoff. We leveled off at 3000 feet. Approximately 200 kts and 10 miles from [our destination] with the runway and field in sight; I selected flaps 10 per pilot flying request. At that time we heard a squealing sound from the back of the aircraft and then promptly received a amber HYD PTU FAIL CAS message. That message extinguished within 3-5 seconds along with the squealing PTU noise. After selecting flaps 20 and gear down; we immediately received an amber L HYD PRESS LOW; a GEAR DISAGREE; and a SPOILER FAIL message. At that point I requested from ATC that we be pulled off the visual approach and given delay vectors to assess the situation. After running the QRH for the L HYD PRESS LOW; we executed the alternate gear extension per the checklists guidance. Once we did that the Amber GEAR DISAGREE CAS message extinguished. Continuing the QRH; we noticed we would not have any nose wheel steering once on the ground and we would need to be towed. I declared an emergency at that point. We informed ATC of the situation giving them the pertinent info. We referenced the QRH for the last message which was the SPOILERS FAULT. I opted to land without using the thrust reverses to mitigate any asymmetrical thrust since we were limited on the ground with our steering. The QRH stated a landing conversion factor of 1.4 without TR use for the HYD PRESS LOW and 1.65 for the SPOILERS FAIL msg. We took the conservative number of 1.65 which gave us a factored landing distance of 4969 feet (3012 x 1.65). We had more than that available so we were satisfied. After announcing the emergency and finishing up the QRH; I took control of the aircraft for the landing. We landed right on centerline and used brakes only to maintain lateral control and stop. Once stopped; men and equipment arrived and chocked us. We then shut down both engines and exited out to pin the gear. We were then towed to the ramp.

We accomplished the after landing checklist but; due to the expedited crossing; I wasn't sure if the First Officer (FO) started the APU (which had been consistent/standard practice so far in the trip). We were cleared to enter the ramp and I consciously elected to leave both engines running (which was contrary to my standard practice during the trip). As we turned to pull into the gate; a white; unmarked van cut across our path. We saw him coming so no immediate stop was necessary but we both remarked about the various fueling and vendor traffic driving habits causing a conflict with aircraft. We pulled to a stop normally; parked the brakes and I believe I commanded 'shut down engines'. The FO believes he heard 'shut down the left engine' (which had been the standard command throughout the trip). He shut down the left engine. The right engine continued to run and we finished the parking checklist and departed the cockpit.Minutes later (approximately three--the running engine burned 155 lbs of fuel since the counter had been reset at left engine shutdown) I received a page as I left the gate area requesting I return to the gate. I returned to find the right engine running. I immediately shut off the fuel lever. No damage or injuries occurred. The aircraft was chocked and the brakes parked. In my estimation; there are three distinct contributing factors in this event.1.) Complacency when reading the checklist. I assumed items had been accomplished; therefore; I felt no need to follow up the response with a tactile and visual check.2.) Complacency when relying on past actions as a predictor of future actions. We had done things the same way each leg; therefore; we would continue to do them the same way on every leg. 3.) Distractions. The expedited crossing to the ramp side of the runway; compressed time frame for completing the after landing checklists and vehicular traffic all led to this event. We are frequently admonished to be aware of all of these issues yet they still keep happening. Strict--unyielding adherence to policy and procedures is a must. No one is perfect and that is why policies and procedures exist. An event like this WILL happen if you allow yourself to become too comfortable.",,"Arrived at the gate and the parking brake was parked. The Captain remarked 'shut down the #1 engine; parking check list' I read the check list as the Captain responded. At the end of the check list I exited the aircraft. I needed to mail some bills I had paid during the layover the night before and I also needed to get something to eat. I had walked about 10 gates down from the aircraft and ordered some food when I heard an announcement asking the fight crew inbound from our flight please return to the gate. I thought that the Captain was most likely still there so I waited on my order and walked back. No one was there when I returned so I waited. About 5 min's later the agent walked up and I asked why she had called. She told me that one of the engines had been left running. She let me on the jet bridge and the Captain was walking off the Aircraft. He had only walked one gate over when he heard the announcement. He returned to the aircraft and shut it down.I believe this problem came about because of a pattern we developed during all our flights. After landing I started the APU shortly after landing. After about 2-3mins; allowing the engines to cool I would shut down the #2 engine at the Captain's request. We did this every flight. After landing on this flight it got very busy. We were clear to cross immediately after landing. I was still cleaning up the aircraft while getting the radio work covered with ground and ramp. When we parked at the gate and the Captain called for me to shut down the #1 engine; I didn't think about the #2 engine still running. We had always shut it down before. I believe the Captain thought the same. I read the check list and listened to the Captains responses. I should have been double checking him myself; but I didn't. I also should not have delayed doing my walk around. I needed to get my bills in the mail and the Captain had told me he could do the walk around if I wanted but I said no that I would do it when I returned. This has never happened to me and I have 28 years of flying commercial aircraft. I don't know what to say about it. I'm embarrassed that it happened to me.

I was SIC and Pilot Flying (from right hand seat). I was also working the radios while preparing to taxi the aircraft.The PIC was configuring the aircraft and FMS. Ground issued a taxi clearance to 'do a 180 on the ramp and then taxi via Delta to 17'. The ramp (a non-movement area) was too narrow to safely make the requested 180 degree turn from out parking spot. Consequently; I taxied forward about 10 feet to get a better angle for the turn. The Ground [Controller] responded to this (in a clearly frustrated tone) by stating: 'okay; you can take A3 and the hold short of Delta at Runway 22.' I read back the instructions and thanked him. As we started braking to hold short of Delta the controller raised his voice and transmitted 'CALLSIGN stop right there! That's two instructions you've missed!' The controller further reprimanded us and stated 'listen up' or words to that effect. We stopped the aircraft just short of Delta. Note: it is difficult to determine where the lateral boundary of Delta begins. The intersection of taxiways Echo; Delta; the ramp and Runway 22 is less of an intersection and more of a wide area that adjoins the ramp. The edges of taxiway Delta is unmarked at that location. The tower then cleared a light aircraft to depart from runway 22. Since the tower was located behind us (5 O'clock as we approached the Echo / Delta / Ramp boundary area) it may have been difficult for the tower to verify that we were stopped short of Delta (and stopped well short of the hold short line at RWY22 and Delta). He cleared other traffic to land on 17 and then cleared us to cross 22 and continue to the end of 17. Upon reaching 17; we switched to the Tower frequency (same controller) and we're told to hold short awaiting release from Center. An experimental called concerned that he'd broken off a landing gear and asked the controller to check for him; the controller said that he saw three gear. He then cleared us for departure without further incident. The tone of the tower controller's transmissions to all aircraft was tense to the point of bordering on unprofessional. This makes for a tense cockpit and adds a layer of distraction during a critical phase of flight. At no time did our aircraft come into conflict with other aircraft or ground vehicles.Recommendations: 1. If unable to conduct the requested taxi operation; communicate that to the ground controller in advance even if maneuvering in a non-movement area. 2. When approaching a holding point that is ambiguous or poorly marked; stop the aircraft sooner to visually communicate intentions with the ground controller. 3. Recommend SWO Port Authority provide better signage or pavement markings at the confluence of the taxiways mentioned above. 4. ATC should refrain from issuing poorly marked locations in hold short clearances.",,,,"A crew departed the SWO Ramp area and because of their confusion about taxiway stop points; particularly at the Taxiway E; D and Ramp intersections; was twice tersely cleared to Runway 17.",

He had been there before and I was briefed by the controller that I relieved that he would be there for another 5 hours. There was no paperwork in the area detailing this flight or pilots intentions. FAY approach called with information. 'Yeah; that Aircraft Y is still doing parachute drops over Maxton; code [deleted]; climbing to 13;500.' I replied; 'Well you know I have a twelve thousand foot aircraft orbiting in that area?' At this time I observed a limited VFR tag climbing out of about 10;700 north of Aircraft X. Liberty owns 11;000 and above; FAY owns 10;000 and below. Fay replied 'Yeah; can you advise him of our traffic and vector your guy away?' I said 'No; he's on a mission and he's orbiting there. I'll see if he can take a turn; I have no idea what he's doing.' 'I have parachute drops; you know about our guys?' FAY replied. 'I don't know anything about your parachute drops' I told him. 'So where exactly is he going to do it; right where Aircraft X is?' I did not get a reply. I hung up; waited for another aircraft to finish checking in and then called the VFR traffic to Aircraft X. 'Traffic 12 o'clock; 2 miles southeast bound; 11;300; climbing VFR; parachute drops.' The jump aircraft was now in my airspace and still VFR. Aircraft X did not have the traffic in sight and said that he was 'Heading west to de-conflict.' Once separated; I asked Aircraft X if he was aware of the jump operations. He did and advised that he had been on UNICOM with the jump aircraft to avoid each other. I asked Aircraft X if he had responded to a TCAS advisory when making his turn and he said; 'yes'; I notified the FLM (Front Line Manager) immediately. Minutes later I received a call from a different FAY controller who advised that the jumpers would stay at 11;500 instead of climbing to 13;500. A much better idea. After being relieved I listened to the tape at the Operations Manager desk and spoke briefly to the Operations Manager about the situation. Later; the Operations Manager advised me that he spoke to the pilot of Aircraft X and that paperwork for the mission had been filed with Fayetteville approach only. Aircraft X would fly missions at different altitudes but mainly 12;000 feet. That's Liberty's airspace; not approach control. The Aircraft X pilot was also going to send over a mission packet for ZDC.The approach controller knew the there was an aircraft at 12;000 in the area of the airport; they had climbed him up there and were still monitoring him. The parachute drop aircraft should have been handed off to Liberty prior to entering Liberty's airspace so that one controller could coordinate with both aircraft to avoid a conflict. Also; moving an IFR aircraft to make way for a VFR is not sound practice. There was no information available at ZDC for Aircraft X flight. The controllers had no idea what the aircraft was doing and what the parameters of the operation were. In fact; Aircraft X's flight plan; as it was received from FAY approach; did not indicate any delay. It was the controller prior to me that had to question the pilot and then update the flight plan to show a 5 hour delay. FAY should have recognized that the aircraft operation was going to be in ZDC airspace and made sure that the paperwork had been forwarded. In addition; our FLMs should have taken the initiative several days ago when the flights first began and requested paperwork on the Aircraft X flight. It is becoming more common to have special military flights with no prior warning or paperwork. If our FLMs would have requested more information several days ago; we could have already had procedures in place to deal with the conflicting parachute jumps.",,,,"ZDC Controller reports about confusion with an aircraft in holding and a skydiving aircraft that wanted to drop above the holding aircraft.

I declared an emergency with ATC and asked for an immediate clearance to return. When the Captain returned to the cockpit I briefed him on our clearance and then we accomplished the 'smoke/fire/ fumes' checklist in the QRH. We continued our descent and return but observed that ZZZ was immediately in front of us. Since FARs and good judgment require us to 'land at the nearest suitable airport' we decided to land at ZZZ instead of the departure airport. We coordinated this with ATC and landed. Due to time constraints an overweight landing checklist was not accomplished. After landing we taxied clear of the runway and when emergency vehicles arrived they said they observed a fire in the right side brakes and asked that we shut down the engines in order to allow them to extinguish the fire. We did and they reported a short time later that the fire was out.

She knew that the smoke was not related to the normal cooking of meals; use of ovens; or coffee makers. She suspected that the smell was coming from the doorjamb area forward of door 4L.A decision was made that a pilot needed to assess the situation. We arranged for a flight attendant to come to the flight deck while I went to the aft galley. Immediately upon reaching the aft galley's forward bulkhead; I was hit by a strong melted electrical burning smell; similar to a burning transformer or a bundle of wires melting/burning through their insulation. Although discoloration; melting of panels was not apparent; the smell persisted for the several seconds I was in the galley area assessing the situation. I instructed the flight attendants in the area to secure non-water fire extinguishers and to be prepared to use them in the event flames or smoke became visible in the area.As I turned to head back to the cockpit I realized that the cabin air quality just a few rows forward; was significantly better than the fumed area in the aft galley.

With visual weather prevailing and ZZZ immediately off the nose of the airplane; the decision was made to expedite landing and shorten our airtime by landing there vs. the departure airport.

When checking in we called out of 6100 meters for 7700 meters. The controller with urgency in his voice; told us to get back down to 5700 meters. I clicked the auto pilot off and pushed the a/c over and got back to 5700 meters in a hurry. At that time I got on the radio and told the controller that we were cleared to 7700 meters and read it back very clearly. From that point on the controller did not want to talk about it. I asked him if he wanted to submit a report; he came back with (I'll call you back) he never did.

After complying with that clearance; the Captain questioned the new controller and told him that the previous controller gave us the wrong altitude of 7700 meters.

We were concerned about the landing weight due to the amount of shortcuts enroute we received. We decided to burn extra fuel to get under landing weight and lowered the flaps to 9 at 11000 feet 245 kts. We were given a descent to 8000 ft. Once level we also lowered the landing gear to burn more fuel. When on vectors for the approach we were then given a 180 turn; and assigned a different runway. While reprogramming the FMS and setting new ILS frequencies the Captain told me to put the gear up; which I did. Shortly afterwards we received a landing gear handle disagree on the EICAS. I was busy reprogramming the FMS and radios and did not look at the speed when I moved the lever; even though I am not required to. During the turn the plane was in 1/2 bank mode in which I did not realize; I was not the pilot flying. After 30 degrees of turn ATC said to increase the rate of turn because of inbound traffic to a different runway. We then received a traffic advisory (TA) due to the inbound traffic. The landing gear disagree may have been due to speed. At 230 kts. He then told me to put the gear back down which I did. During the turn we were slowing at a very fast rate and ATC continued to give us new vectors. By the time I was able to look down and see the speed we were already at 180 and slowing rapidly. I called out 'speed speed' and placed my hand behind the trust lever with the captains to advance it. We received the stick shaker as the plane was accelerating. The Captain called for gear up then reduced the thrust again. While in the turn still receiving vectors we received a second stick shaker in which the Captain immediately corrected. I finished programming the FMS and radios and the rest of the flight was uneventful. We oversped the gear cause of being reassigned a new runway coupled with landing weight issues and poor aircraft management. We received the shaker because of the EICAS warning coupled with the TA as well as handling multiple calls from ATC. We should have asked for an extended vector to allow time to set up for the new approach. And we should have left the gear in the down position while being vectored.",,"Due to an early ATC short-cut (nearly direct to field); headwinds less than predicted and landing RWYs 27/28(Straight-in). We projected landing above MLW. We leveled at FL200 (vice planned FL240); and descended early to 16;000. At 35 nm; below 10 k and 250 kts; flaps 9. Still project above MLW; 25 NM LG down.On vectors to final RWY 27L. At 20NM RWY changed to 28C; followed a few seconds later by a turn 180 degrees away from the field. I turned the HDG bug; but the aircraft was slow to turn. Re-selected HDG and noted in 1/2 bank. Touch Control Steering (TCS) autopilot (AP) off and rolled into 30 degree bank (as ATC was calling again to turn). My thought process now changed from needing to burn fuel (MLW) to saving fuel (going away from airport; weather getting worse and distant alternate). I was concentrating on alt; bank angle and heading; when I called for landing gear (LG) up. As my scan reached the airspeed I saw 220-230 kts and realized the over-speed. The LG showed in-transit; (amber) ECIS (LG/Lever disagree) I called for LG Down.During the turn I had the power back; anticipating LG retraction; at 180 Kts; flaps 9 and 30 degrees bank I added a little too much back pressure (was 200 ft. low; trying to correct) and got a momentary stick shaker.Powered up and bank reduction stopped stick shaker immediately. Once I rolled out; I slowed back to 180 kts; retracted LG; 200 kts retracted flaps. Autopilot on; verified new FMS/Nav data. Briefed new approach and sent message to Maintenance (MX).After landing waited for MX to add any info they needed to augment the write-up. Flight segments with unusual configuration; i.e.; LG extended early to burn fuel; require special attention. Anything being done outside the normal routine should be briefed as a specific event.

On takeoff roll with power set and about 110 knots I felt the plane yaw to the left as if we encountered a crosswind gust; but there was also a change in engine sound and then I noticed the N1 drop about 10%. It recovered to just about takeoff thrust only to roll back again. At about 130 knots I elected to reject the takeoff. We didn't declare an emergency as there were no overheat or other abnormal indications. We cleared the runway and contacted maintenance after reassuring the passengers that all was well and were told to have the fire department check our tires and brakes for any abnormalities.

I pressed N1; adjusted the throttles and announced 'thrust set'. After the speed check; the plane accelerated normally. At approximately 110 knots I saw the left N1 gauge drop from 100% to about 80% and back in 1-2 seconds; and felt a slight pull to the left. I announced 'left engine...' and before I could say 'surge'; it happened again and the CA was initiating the abort procedure. Our speed peaked at 132 knots.

We decided to go shoot some stop and go's at Arlington Municipal (AWO). At 3;000 ft and 10 miles south; we tuned the weather on the field and noted the winds were favoring 34. We confirmed this by dialing up the CTAF and listening to other traffic in the pattern. We entered the airport environment at 3;000 and 5 miles and made a radio call stating our intentions to land Rwy 34 while reporting our position in miles from the airport and altitude. Abeam the airport and to the west by about 4 miles we had reached TPA of 1200 feet. Making another radio call and stating our intentions to make a 45 degree entry to the downwind for RWY 34. Not soon after we heard a call from a Piper Chieftan reporting that they were over island crossing (a common reporting point for the airport) and were entering a 45 to the downwind for RWY 34. Then a particularly excited call came from another Cessna in the area saying that he also was over island crossing and did not have the Chieftan in sight. The Chieftan then proceeded to announce that he wasn't actually over island crossing; but was actually over the casino. The problem here is the Chieftan pilot did not once state his position in relation to the airport or altitude and there just so happens to be two large Casinos in the area. I assumed the Chieftan pilot was over the casino located southwest of the field (behind us) when in fact he was North of the field. This is where I should have queried the Chieftan pilot to specify his position in direction and distance from the airport. My student and I reported island crossing and entered the 45 to the downwind for RWY 34 number 2 to land and my student sights the Chieftan to our 9 o'clock and I take the controls and alter course to my right as does the Chieftan driver.

To make this situation worse was the fact that moderate turbulence was being reported below FL330.This is absolutely unacceptable for a controller to not know what the separation standard is between 2 IFR aircraft they have separation responsibility for. If the equipment (ATOPS) that ZOA uses doesn't recognize what separation needs to be applied the controller needs to have the ability to override this. HCF needs to have ATOPS installed to ensure a smoother transition from RADAR separation to OCEANIC Non-radar separation since ZOA doesn't have the ability to override what the ATOPS is erroneously telling the controller.",,,,"HCF Controller describes a situation where ZOA Oceanic wouldn't accept an aircraft at an altitude because the ZOA controller thought they needed 15 minutes of separation.

What the controller meant was for us to go to SEEVR; and join the SEEVR ONE RNAV ARRIVAL [Jeppesen title page 60-2Q]. The controller told us we were looking high at SEEVR. That got our attention; and we finally figured out that we were heading to the same fix [SEEVR]; but cleared for a different arrival; with a different crossing restriction [of between] 13000-16000.

Braking action was reported as good by the previous arrival. ATIS reported thin; patchy ice on taxiways and ramps; and stated that the tower would give specific taxi instructions upon landing due to numerous taxiway closures. As I applied the brakes normally on landing; I noticed one slick spot on the runway; with the rest of the runway being dry. At 80 knots the captain took the aircraft; slowed the aircraft and turned off on taxiway B; as all high speed taxiways were closed. Taxiway Bravo was a 90 degree turn off with a slight downhill incline. As we turned off onto Bravo we slid slightly but were able to regain control for a few feet; then began sliding again. The captain and I were both on the brakes and he deployed the thrust reversers to try to stop the airplane; and he had the tiller over to try to regain directional control. Despite our efforts to stop; the airplane continued to slide into the grass until we came to a stop. Nobody was injured and the aircraft was undamaged. The event occurred because of the poor conditions of the taxiways. The braking action on the taxiway was nil; but was not reported as such. Although our speed was very slow upon turning off the runway; the ice on the taxiway and the slight downhill incline rendered directional control impossible. The condition of the taxiways was not accurately reported; which is also why two other aircraft slid into the grass that morning. Although the runway was bare and dry with good braking action; none of the taxiways had the same snow and ice removal priority. If conditions are bad enough that aircraft controllability becomes an issue; that information must be clearly and accurately disseminated to aircraft before landing. The difference between a NOTAM for 'patchy thin ice on taxiways' and an advisory for 'braking action nil on taxiways' is monumental; and could have resulted in either delaying the flight until airport operations cleared the taxiways or canceling the flight.",,"...airport operations personnel came out to get us out of the grassy area we were in. They needed a lot of sand to provide traction for the tug. At one point during the [subsequent] pushback on to the taxiway the tug and airplane almost slid back down into the grassy area again due to the extreme icy surface conditions. We had to apply full brakes to prevent another incident. Everything that happened that day occurred at very low ground speeds.",,"Although braking action was good on the runway as advertised the taxiway where the EMB-145 exited the runway had not been sanded or otherwise treated; directional control was lost and the aircraft slid into an adjacent grassy area from which it was eventually towed to the gate.

Near LIT ATC reassigned us on the SEEVR1 and cleared us direct RRNET. We were then told to descend to FL260. Just prior to SWTCH intersection we were cleared to 'Descend via the BRDJE1; delete the speeds except comply beginning at SEEVR.' We had SEEVR1 in the GFMS and on our iPads and; as the Pilot Flying I noticed I had to rush to comply with the crossing restriction at THEMM (between FL230 and FL210). I began a descent and was at FL230 before I realized we had been reassigned to the BRDJE1 and had the wrong arrival programmed into the GFMS. I crossed TUSLE intersection at FL230; 3000 feet low; and then resumed the BRDJE1 Arrival without further incident. Many of the RNAV Arrivals into DFW have the same names for fixes with vastly different crossing restrictions. Were SEEVR intersection assigned a different name for the BRDJE1 Arrival; that would have not matched up with what I was seeing on my iPad or on the GFMS and would have clued me in on the reassignment when ATC told us to 'comply beginning at SEEVR.' Also a factor was that the timing of the reassignment was late into the SEEVR1 Arrival and was not accompanied by any verbal indicator such as 'now cleared via the BRDJE1 Arrival...'",,"It is obvious to us that it is a bad idea to mix waypoint and arrival names on different arrivals.

We chose that runway because the ILS to 25 did not require me to hand fly any portion of the approach. With 31 I would have required me to fly the approach on the last 1;000 feet. We did this to reduce work load. At about 500 AGL the airport operations called us on the radio and said that he had not done any preparation to runway 25. He had anticipated us using 31 and had spent all of his time working on that runway. We continued the approach with that information in mind. I was expecting to see snow and we could see black pavement. We assumed that the runway was fine. After landing there was not any notable problems to the runway. I stowed the thrust reverser's and began to apply the brakes. There was not any braking action. I re-applied the thrust reverser's to stop the airplane. The braking was nil. We got the airplane stopped and slowly taxied to the terminal. After arriving in the hotel I called dispatch to ask what information they had on braking action on the runways in BJI. They said they received reports that the report indicated fair to poor [earlier]. If that was the time [they received report from their location in the mountain west region] then they received the report while we were enroute. I looked at the braking action report the next morning and there was only a braking action report for runway 31/13. Knowing that; I believe that runway 25 based on the conditions should have been notamed closed. This would have shown up on the release and center would have told us that it was closed when we asked for the ILS to 25. This would have re-directed us to runway 31 where the operations truck was expecting us and had done all the work. We did not receive any braking action reports from dispatch. When we called in range we did not receive any braking action reports from operations. The first indication that there might have been a problem was when we were about to land. The report from the operations truck working on the runway was not clear as to the threat. There were not any notams in our release stating runway conditions. There was one notam but I cannot remember what it was anymore. According to the dispatcher there is a problem with them receiving braking action reports. They receive them as faxes. They then go in a file. If that is true that information is not available at the time the release is generated; especially with time zone changes. It would have been helpful to receive the report from operations when we called in range. It would have also been helpful if the operations truck driver that was working on the runway would have stated that he was treating the runway for ice. I feel that there were several opportunities to get us information that were missed. The dispatcher said that because they receive these reports via fax they don't get the same attention as if they were reported to the FAA and came out as notams.",,"Captain was the pilot flying and decided to land on 25; NOTAM indicated airport surfaces fair to poor. This was decided because the autopilot could fly approach to minimums and I thought it was acceptable while in the poor weather conditions to reduce pilot workload. Within 500 AGL airport ops made a radio call (the first of which we heard from them) and asked if it was too late for us to land on 31. The captain said he would continue to land on 25; I relayed the message. Immediately airport ops told us 25 had not been sanded and he did not get work on 25. I queried the captain by saying 'Are you sure you want 25?' Captain again said we would land on 25. While becoming very close to 25 we could see there was no snow cover and felt it was acceptable to use 25. On roll out the captain indicated he had ZERO braking; he applied full reverse thrust and we came to a stop at a 45 degree angle mid runway with the wing over the runway end identifier lights. The runway conditions were not properly reported to us. Had airport ops told us 25 was completely covered in black ice (the kind you don't see); or the braking is nil; we would not for a second consider landing on it.

While we were turning I was finishing the checklist where I put both compasses back to MAG mode. Both primary compasses slewed while we were in the turn and when we rolled out we were almost 60 degrees off heading. ATC asked what our heading was [while] both primary indicators read 290; to which I responded 290 heading. ATC said they were showing 230 heading.

The decision was then made to abort the takeoff. We taxied off the runway to complete the QRH for aborted takeoff. The captain then informed maintenance; dispatch; and the on-call chief pilot that a high speed abort had occurred. Even though we completed a takeoff briefing and before takeoff checklist; we missed the fact the speeds had not been entered. After complying with the QRH checklist and waiting the required 15 minutes we re-briefed the takeoff and completed a before takeoff checklist; taking extra care to ensure all takeoff data was entered correctly. The flight continued without incident.Multiple threats led to the significant error that the captain and I failed to recognize and manage appropriately. After this event the captain and I had many questions about how we could have missed this error even though we completed a before takeoff checklist. We expected and were assigned runway 24L in CLE for departure. From our gate this was a very short taxi. Additionally the entire ramp area was covered in about an inch of ice with poor braking action reported. Most of our attention during the taxi-out from the ramp was devoted to the poor surface conditions. This was time we normally would have begun briefing the takeoff due to such a short taxi to the runway. Upon leaving the ramp there was question about our taxi instructions. We clarified the instructions with ground control and continued taxiing toward the end of the runway. This took even more time away from us as we neared the runway. I then began briefing the approach. To the best of my knowledge I briefed the airspeeds; but it is evident I did not follow my usual habit of cross checking the set speeds with the TDM I was briefing from. We were nearing the runway at this point and I made the PA instructing the Flight Attendants (FA) to be seated. We promptly heard back from them and I began to run the before takeoff checklist very quickly. I did not follow the proper checklist procedure in making sure all the speeds were set when I replied 'verified ' to the flight instruments and speed bugs checklist item. We were then immediately cleared for takeoff and we took the runway to begin the takeoff roll. While at the time I did not feel rushed; looking back on it; I was. The Captain and I failed to recognize that the time constraint caused by all of the before mentioned threats was impacting the quality of our briefings and the usage of our checklists. It was our job to manage these threats and we didn't. Informing ground or tower before takeoff that we needed a few minutes to run some checklists would have given us plenty of time to brief and properly complete the before takeoff checklist. We also could have briefed before aircraft movement on the ramp. I normally would enter the speeds myself as soon as the TDM arrives; but I was in the bathroom when this occurred and I did not verify they were entered during the post TDM briefing. I should have been more vigilant at that point as well. The captain and I had been flying together for three days and we had become confident in each other's abilities and perhaps we let our guard down due to how much we trusted each other.In the future I will be more aware of the threats associated with a short taxi to the runway and make sure all briefings and checklists are completed correctly; even if this means briefing before taxi-out or informing ATC we are not ready for takeoff and need a few minutes to complete our checklists.",,,,"CL600 First Officer reported rejecting the takeoff at 90 knots when the flight crew realized takeoff speeds had not been set.",

We delayed configuration and taxi checklist until past all hot spots.  This caused a significant disruption in our normal checklist procedure. I heard the Captain call for the flight control check.  While he certainly must have called for 'Flaps 10' just before calling for the flight control check; I didn't hear it; and therefore did not react to it by putting the flaps to 10.  It is completely my fault on this.  Even if the captain had not called for the flaps; I should have asked him about them.  I have no explanation other than my mind 'skipped ahead' and just missed it. Perhaps I subconsciously thought the flaps had already been extended. When I read the Flaps 2 times in the checklist; I saw what I expected to see; not the actual flap position.Although I tried to get quality rest/sleep the night before; that just did not happen prior to this flight.   It's hard to get a perfectly restful night's sleep in our kind of job (due to circadian rhythm changes); but perhaps I was more fatigued than what I had realized.  I could have at the least; alerted the other crew members of this.  Also; our work has very tight time constraints with respect to on-time departures.  I tend to be slower; or less efficient in general preparation for departures than most crew members.  Due to this; I constantly push myself to 'get things done' as promptly as possible.  But when you push yourself to be 'too fast'; it is possible to miss critical events; especially when one is not adequately rested. IN THE FUTURE; I AM GOING TO BE MORE DELIBERATE; AND PERHAPS A LITTLE SLOWER ON THESE CRITICAL CHECKLIST ITEMS.  I do not blame the company or anyone else for my errors in this incident.",,"Upon reaching the runway; I set takeoff power; and immediately saw and heard the TAKEOFF CONFIG warning; which occurred at very low speed. I rejected the takeoff; taxied free of the runway; and conducted a normal flight to our destination.First of all; our taxi route was mostly hot-spots; so I delayed configuration and the taxi checklist; which was non-normal and probably a distraction. I should have configured and run the checks prior to the complex taxi route. Next; I am a recently transitioned 747-200 Captain. On my earlier aircraft; the flap procedure was better verified. I am totally ashamed at having attempted a takeoff with zero flaps. That is a problem. In terms of helping myself as well as others; the flap setting should be a mutual call. Twice. I flew the -200 for 10 years and the error never; ever happened when the captain was involved during the taxi check. I take total responsibility for what happened; but also see some problems with both our procedures and the culture than engineered them. As it stands; the captain's verification of the flap setting takes place while positioning the aircraft for takeoff and communicating with the tower. What we did was unacceptable; but I can imagine procedures that would prevent this from happening again.",,"A B-747 air crew rejected a takeoff after a TAKEOFF CONFIG warning alerted them that the flaps were not set for takeoff.

I shut down the APU and completed the termination checklist. Approximately 2 minutes after external power was applied we; the pilots on flight deck; heard a series of disconnects and popping sounds and a total loss of external power occurred within 10 seconds. I tried to restart the APU again yet it was not out of it's cool down cycle after initial; normal parking shutdown sequence and a fault in the APU start was annunciated. In less than a minute; about 30 seconds; the flight deck was completely engulfed in thick; black; toxic smoke and fumes.As I saw the intrusion of the smoke; I ordered the flight deck crew out of the flight deck. I then opened the flight deck windows to evacuate the smoke and fumes and realized that the situation was intensifying and that I was in danger of becoming incapacitated. I then left for the forward Flight Attendant (FA) communications station at door 1L and made a PA throughout the aircraft for an evacuation through the main door only as we only had a few remaining passengers on board (less than 20) and the entire crew left on the aircraft to evacuate. In less than 30 seconds everyone hurriedly left the 1L exit. I further ensured everyone was off the aircraft.While I was making the cabin evacuation assessment a Maintenance Technician circled round me and was now on the flight deck in the captain's seat assessing this situation. I returned to the flight deck and the smoke had dissipated considerably yet I heard the technician coughing repeatedly. I stood upright and over the main throttle console. My breathing too was labored so I dawned the jump seat O2 mask and selected 100% pressure breathing. I motioned to the Maintenance Technician to dawn his mask and he shook his hand to indicate no. He did not speak to me in English and I do not speak his language. He then tested the fire system and we had a forward cargo fire light illuminate. From my disadvantage view; I could not tell if he had pressed the extinguisher or not. By his actions; I assumed he was now taking control of the flight deck. During this time the lead FA; came to the flight deck dawned with a PBE and both a water and Halon fire extinguisher. I told him not to use the water one as it was inappropriate for electric fires and that there was no evidence of a fire on the flight deck and he would further damage the flight deck electronics and equipment. If the agents of the Halon extinguisher were to be used. I asked him to leave the flight deck. His total time on the flight deck was less than 30 seconds.Fire and rescue arrived within a minute of the start of the event and a ground agent foamed the external receptacle with a Halon extinguisher as depicted in a video available for review. The fire/ rescue team further foamed the external power connection outlets and nose gear area. As the Maintenance Technician continued his series of system tests on the aircraft systems; I felt there was nothing more for me to do and I left the aircraft in the control of Maintenance and fire/rescue and station management. I when out to the ramp area and stayed away from personal yet I took pictures and immediately forwarded them with an email to the Operations Manager. The Manager de-briefed me in my hotel room about 2 hours after the event.

He returned to the cockpit and a discussion of our situation followed.After lengthy discussions as we approached Coast Out to ETOPS airspace; we decided the most safe course of action was to turn the aircraft around and stay within close proximity of emergency alternates should the indications recur.  We briefed procedures and alternates throughout the return to ZZZ.  Since we never had a confirmed malfunction or irregular operation; we did not declare an emergency.  Safe landing in ZZZ occurred with no new indications of smoke or fire.  Maintenance and Dispatch were consulted throughout the evolution via SATCOM in flight and in person once blocked in.

I was the Pilot Monitoring (PM) and the First Officer was the Pilot Flying (PF). Upon joining the localizer at 3;000 feet we encountered wake turbulence from the 747. At this point the First Officer decided to hand fly the approach to stay above the wake turbulence and maintain a path to the runway above the glide slope. We were instructed to maintain 170 knots until the final approach fix and to contact tower at the final approach fix. As the First officer was configuring for landing; he called 'Flaps 5; Vee-Approach.' I was immediately confused by what he was asking for and while selecting flaps to the 5 position I asked what he meant. He again said 'Vee-Approach' and I still didn't know what he wanted; thinking he wanted me to select some sort of approach mode. His intention was for me to bug the VAPP speed. At this point he changed the speed selector to FMS speeds to begin a slowdown of the aircraft and by this time the flaps had moved to 5 and the overspeed limit came down to our current airspeed which was just below 180. We then encountered more wake turbulence which increased the speed to 181 knots causing a brief overspeed of the flaps. This was immediately corrected by the First Officer and he began decreasing to approach speed. Due to the flap overspeed; I was side-tracked thinking about the maintenance implications and a potential event being triggered. Also as the First Officer was flying; I was paying attention to his approach in reference to the 747 to assure that if we encountered any more wake turbulence; we would both be ready to deal with it. In the midst of all of this happening; I forgot to switch over to the tower frequency at the final approach fix. Just prior to the 500 feet call out; we encountered more wake turbulence; so we again were distracted by this; ultimately resulting in landing without receiving a landing clearance. We realized what happened once we taxied clear of the runway and queried the tower. They responded with taxi instructions; and eventually had us switch to ground control without a mention of the incident. Once I arrived at the gate; and after calling maintenance for the over speed inspection; I called the tower and spoke with Mr. X to assure there was no conflict. He told me that there were no issues whatsoever due to this event and they understood we got distracted by our flight duties and said not to worry about it. This event was caused by a chain of events beginning with the concern for the wake turbulence. If the First Officer would have made a more specific call out for the speed reduction; the flap overspeed would not have occurred and I would not have been distracted from my Pilot Monitoring duties. Additionally; if I would have verified the speed was below company limits prior to selecting flaps 5; I could have potentially avoided the overspeed. As far as landing without clearance; I should have confirmed the landing light switches were turned on at 500 feet; but due to the wake turbulence and overspeed distraction; I overlooked this. The First Officer also should have confirmed with me that we were cleared to land prior to his callout of 'landing.'",,"[Report narrative contained no additional information].",,"ERJ-175 flight crew reported landing without clearance in ATL when they were distracted by several events; including a wake vortex encounter.",

The Other Airline (OAL) pilot occupying the flight deck jump seat (Air Carrier Y Captain) indicated that his Audio Control Panel (ACP) was not responding to commands. His mic had been in the 'off' position. I called Dispatch/Maintenance Control (MXC) over Radio and asked for advice on how to proceed. MXC referred us to QRH page for 'unresponsive audio control panel'. In flight; the procedure was to place the ACP in backup mode; which we did. There was no change to the ACP.  MXC suggested continuing to ZZZ1 and writing it up on the ground; then ended our conversation over the radio. I continued the conversation over ACARS and expressed my concern that there was an electrical problem with ACP3; due to the nature of the sounds (sounded like electrical arcing or shorting wires); the flashing lights on the panel; and the interference with our Comm-1 and 2. I asked for MXC's blessing to pull Circuit Breaker (CB) C18; which is referenced in the 'on the ground' part of the QRH reset procedure.  MXC would not give direction to pull the breaker but said 'it is up to you if you would like to pull the breaker'. After discussion with the First Officer (FO); and confirming with MXC that ACP3 is the only component powered by CB C18; I pulled the breaker. All erratic sounds and flickering stopped. We continued to monitor ACP3 for irregularities until landing in ZZZ1. MXC explained on the ground; after completion of the flight; that they were unable to give direction not specifically provided for in the QRH. I expressed my frustration that I did not feel Maintenance was supportive enough in providing information we needed to make a decision. I had to specifically ask what components would be affected by the CB.

After I made this suggesting the crew's first response is 'do we have an approved procedure for that?' I once again referred the crew to their POH section 5-55 page 6.  The crew refused to perform the OEM approved procedure to prevent a non issue from becoming an AOG event. The crew then called their Chief Pilot and reported this as a Safety issue. Once maintenance personnel arrived and performed a CMC download and submitted the data to the Embraer Contact Center for evaluation; they responded that it was some transient in the system; and that taking into consideration that all messages went away on the next power up; there was no need for any further troubleshooting on this matter.  The technician then proceeded to perform the ops test on the Engine/Airframe unit with no faults found and the aircraft was returned to service.  This situation has created a conflict in the tasks set for the Maintenance Control department. We are tasked with providing technical support and being a resource for the flight crews. When a Maintenance Controller offers a flight crew an OEM approved procedures from a Pilots Operating Handbook and is then accused of suggesting an unsafe procedure it creates unwanted stress in an already stressful work environment. Flight crews and Maintenance Controllers need to be notified if a crew is not allowed to follow a procedure listed in a Pilot Operating Handbook or other OEM published manuals for their specific aircraft or if maintenance control is not allowed to suggest these procedures. This should be addressed by the Heads of the maintenance and operations department to determine what the SOP should be for events similar to this in the future.

While climbing out at the end of the practice procedure; at around 500 AGL; I was talking to the student about ELT operations when I noticed the indicator on our portable carbon monoxide detector was indicating the presence of carbon monoxide inside the cabin. I told my student 'We might have carbon monoxide in here;' and my student immediately replied he was feeling lightheaded. I immediately turned off our cabin heat and window defroster; which had been turned on to a low setting at the beginning of the flight; and instructed the student to open his window. I resumed control of the aircraft. At around 2;000 feet MSL I began to experience lightheadedness as well; which subsided after about a minute thanks to the fresh air coming through the window. We were 10 miles northeast of ZZZ at this time; inbound towards the airport; so I increased power to maintain best forward airspeed; listened to the ZZZ ATIS; and then called ZZZ ATCT. I advised the controller that we had a possible carbon monoxide issue inside the aircraft. The controller provided us with our pattern entry instructions and asked if we would like equipment standing by; to which I responded negative. By this time the student and I felt normal again; so I offered him the controls again; and he resumed control. When on the midfield right downwind to RWY 5 at ZZZ; I again began experiencing some intermittent lightheadedness; as did he. I resumed control of the airplane and kept us fairly close to the runway so that we didn't spend more time than we needed to in the air. Upon landing; I immediately opened the cabin door to allow more fresh air inside the cabin; and both the student and I experienced relief once again. In retrospect it would have been a good idea to have a medic meet us at the ramp. I had not expected our symptoms to return after my student and I initially started feeling better. I am grateful to my company for installing the portable carbon monoxide detectors; as they aid in detecting potential carbon monoxide prior to the onset of severe physiological symptoms. My symptoms and those of my student were not severe enough to prevent us from maintaining control of the aircraft.","Reporter stated he was flying a Piper PA-28 Warrior with the standard Lycoming O-320-A engine. The aircraft had a stock heater; not an add-on or combustion type heater. There is a tab; a small handle for selecting defrost and cabin heat; but no fan. A tube with a small flapper controls the heat coming from the engine. Reporter stated their Chief Instructor informed him that Maintenance had done extensive troubleshooting and could not locate any cracks in the engine's exhaust manifold system. Two test flights were also performed; trying to find any indication of carbon monoxide or a possible source. Their Maintenance technicians are very professional; but were somewhat frustrated in not finding the cause for the carbon monoxide. He has since flown the same aircraft 8-10 hours a week and has not experienced any further carbon monoxide poisoning.

SFB ground automatically issue a hold short instruction and then issue a crossing instruction immediately after the read back. I believe this is a serious safety and compliance issue as it conditions pilots to expect the crossing instruction. Compounding this issue is that runway 9C has its own tower frequency that Company aircraft are never told to monitor. In fact; I would guess that 99% of SFB pilots don't know what the frequency is for this runway as it is not on the Jeppesen plate for the airport. Company aircraft are routinely being given a clearance to cross a runway by a controller other than the one controlling operations on the runway.

The pattern at that point got really busy. On downwind we were told to make a right 360 and re-enter downwind: we did. Then we were told to extend and look for a Skyhawk over the VOR we were number 4 to land and that we would be turning in front of a Seminole 5 miles past the VOR. We spotted a plane with lights just crossing the VOR; but we could only count 2 planes on final my student was on the comms the whole time and did a great job inquiring if we were number 4 and that we were following the plane over the VOR.The tower confirmed that so we started turning inbound on an extended left base as that plane crossed the VOR. I then noticed a plane about a mile past the VOR on final and told my student to re-enter downwind. We allowed that Skyhawk to pass however we were confused because that Skyhawk wasn't over the VOR and originally I confused it for the Seminole. The Tower controller then yelled at us for starting to cut in front of our traffic and we apologized. We asked for a touch and go but she cleared us to land at that point. We continued on to land and she asked us to get off at B1; however; there was a plane holding short of runway 4 at B1 so I told my student to continue to B2 and expedite.

The primary runway was closed and we needed to use runway 31 for departure. This entailed crossing 2 runways; one of which had a light aircraft on it that we were to pass behind. It was a short taxi from the gate to the runway and I was inundated with checklists; briefings and the multiple runway crossings. I called the tower and advised we were ready for takeoff. We were cleared for takeoff and the captain ordered me to perform the takeoff checklist. When I looked at the overhead panel; I realized the fuel pumps were off indicating the second engine had not been started. I advised the captain that the engine was not started. We had already taxied over the hold short line; so I advised the tower we needed to clear the runway and taxi back to the approach end. After engine start; we reran all the appropriate checklists and departed without incident. It is worth noting that the aircraft could not have taken off with one engine shut down since the thrust lever was in the shutoff/locked position. A FADEC controlled engine like those installed on Embraer aircraft would not have such a safeguard. We were not more than a few feet over the hold short line when I made the captain aware of the situation and we never initiated the takeoff sequence.

Flying in Hawaii; and per 135.183; we're required to remain within gliding distance in our single-engine Cessna Caravan. The minimum altitude to cross the Molokai Channel is 5000 ft. MSL. The Caravan can glide roughly two miles per 1000 ft. of altitude; no wind. We had departed VFR and planned to do a visual approach into Honolulu. Upon switching to Honolulu Approach we requested the Freeway 2 arrival. The controller cleared us through the Bravo airspace and told us to turn to heading 230; descend and maintain 2000 ft. MSL. That heading brought us further off-shore; so we began a very slow descent down to 2000. After failing to receive a turn on-shore; we queried the controller about a turn inbound. The controller came on and said; 'If you don't increase your descent to 2000; I'm not going to be able to turn you in.' My captain got on the radio and informed the controller about our glide distance. The controller; in a much more agitated tone; told us once again that he could not turn us in unless we descended. My captain told him that we could not descend; reiterated our requirement to remain within glide; and requested a turn inbound. The controller; even more agitated; told us that he couldn't turn us unless we descended and informed us that we were in a departure corridor. When we asked what altitude we needed to be at before he could turn us; he told us that we needed to be below 4000 ft. MSL. We had to choose between descending slowly and going further outbound before turning on-shore or descending quickly; violating glide; and getting a quicker turn on-shore. In order to get into the airport; my captain complied with the controller's instructions. The request was a double-edge sword: either violate the controller's instructions or violate our glide requirement. I have been told that the approach control facility has been notified time and time again of our requirement to remain within glide; yet some controllers will not take that into consideration when issuing instructions.",,,,"A C208 flight crew inbound to PHNL requested a Freeway Visual approach but soon learned that the altitudes required for doing so overwater were incompatible with their requirement to remain within gliding distance of land when operating over water.",

This type of airplane normally cruises around 2400 or 2500 RPM and any variation is abnormal.  As the instructor pilot and PIC; I normally check the mixture setting in case of engine roughness to help correct any mistake by the pilot flying.  The mixture had been set for peak RPM at 3;000 MSL and again at top of climb.  Adjusting the mixture to a more rich setting did not help; and the surges slowly increased with periodic power losses of 300 RPM.  Turning on the carburetor heat seemed to have no effect other than the usual 100 RPM decrease in power.  The full rich mixture setting seemed to help slightly; but the surges continued. I evaluated precautionary landing locations and decided that any course deviation would take us away from the only nearby fields that were clear of trees and water.  The closest suitable airports were beyond power off range.  I considered reporting to ATC but the frequency was too busy to spend any time waiting to get a word in edgewise.  I decided I would need to change the transponder code if we attempted a landing. I performed a configuration flow to verify fuel and ignition settings.  Further adjustments to the engine controls led to a power loss of more than 1;000 RPM.  Immediately applying carburetor heat restored most of the power.  After this; when I turned off the carburetor heat; the engine nearly shut down again after a few seconds.  This happened two or three times; which seemed to confirm we had an induction problem rather than a fuel problem or random surging.  After that; I left the carburetor heat on; moved the throttle fully forward; and reset the mixture control to peak RPM to try to increase the temperature.  I also pulled firmly on the carburetor heat control for a few minutes because these controls have a tendency to slide in and sometimes seem to work better when pulled beyond the normal range of movement. The engine surging stopped with full carburetor heat.  We had nearly full power and had lost only 100 feet of altitude.  I tried reporting to ATC at that point and did not get a response until the second or third attempt.  I advised that we were experiencing carburetor icing and seemed to have it under control. After several minutes; I turned off the carburetor heat and we were able to continue the flight with full power restored.  I ensured the carburetor heat was turned back on before each change to the throttle setting. Closer to our destination; I monitored our ETA carefully because we were within 0.2 hours of the minimum fuel requirement; based on preflight visual inspection with a fuel gauge; the airplane's hour meter; and performance tables in the flight manual.  When we were handed off to the tower frequency; I calculated that we would land with exactly 0.5 hours fuel remaining; and I reported 'minimum fuel' on our initial call to the tower.  At the time; the left fuel gauge indicated empty; and the right fuel gauge indicated more than 1 hour fuel remaining.  The landing was uneventful.  Upon parking we found the left tank had no measurable fuel; and the right tank had 10 minutes of usable fuel. On the return flight; I added 7% to the fuel flow rate calculation which proved to be accurate; and there were no further problems. Contributing to the multiple near-shutdowns of the engine on this flight were lack of safety equipment; instrumentation; and accurate operational information.  The airplane was not equipped with injection type induction; carburetor ice detection; engine gas temperature indication; fuel flow rate indication; or a fuel totalizer.  As a result; there was no early warning of the induction problem or potential icing conditions; no way to precisely set the mixture or to achieve peak EGT for carburetor heating; no indication of higher than normal fuel flow; and no way to accurately measure fuel remaining while in flight. The airplane's manual contains a carburetor icing emergency procedure that was inadequate to prepare me for this situation.  It simply says; 'A gradual loss of RPM and eventual engine roughness may result from the formation of carburetor ice.  To clear the ice; apply full throttle and pull the carburetor heat knob full out until the engine runs smoothly.'  In this situation; the engine's surging and abrupt loss of RPM did not fit the description of a gradual power loss. Contributing to the delay in communicating safety-critical information to ATC were frequency congestion; having only one radio installed in the airplane; and both pilots being task saturated to prevent an unsafe engine failure. Human performance was optimal in this situation.  Workload management was handled correctly with task delegation and prioritization.  Risk management techniques were applied correctly; although I need to re-evaluate fuel management risks in the Aircraft category of the PAVE checklist.",,,,"C152 instructor pilot reported dealing with a rough running engine that finally responded to carburetor heat.",

The engine continued to surge from 900-1000 rpm to 2400 rpm (full power). The aircraft was in a climb attitude at approximately 1400 fpm climb. As the engine surged; the aircraft would continue to climb; then when the engine lost power; the aircraft would descend. I was able to turn to set up a landing on the closed runway used by the Radio controlled aircraft club; however I was too fast (110mph) and too close in to make that runway. I then continued on to land on the remaining portion of that runway however; just at touch down; the engine again surged to full power and the aircraft entered a steep climb. At this time I was over the Mustang Point area of the airport at approximately 100 ft. and 120 mph. The engine continued to run at climb power for several seconds before quitting again. While under power; I was able to turn for an intended landing on runway 05 however the engine lost power again at just short of alignment with the runway so I extended the speed brake and executed a normal landing on taxiway alpha. There were no other aircraft operating either in the air or on the ground at the airport at the time. Upon a normal taxi to the run up area at the east end of the airport; I stopped the aircraft to evaluate the situation and determine the cause of the engine surge. I discovered the fuel valve to be set on the main fuel tank (as is normal for takeoff) however it was out of the detent and partially closed; restricting full fuel flow to the engine. This condition caused the power surges as the carburetor bowl would fill (full power) then use the fuel and cut off as the bowl would refill for the next surge. The aircraft is equipped with a main (header) tank holding 22 gal with 21.5 gal useable and had 17.5 gal on board at the time. The fuel valve has been removed at this time and will be replaced with a fuel valve with a spring loaded position locking pin instead of a decent to prevent a partial on condition. As an experienced experimental aircraft builder and test pilot I have become familiar with this type of test flight and always conduct test flights at low activity times at the airport and announce over Unicom that I am conducting a test flight and may need to use an alternate runway to land. This test flight was conducted with full safety in mind with an on ground observer; fire extinguisher and following published test flight procedures.",,,,"When the power on the pilot's experimental aircraft started to surge dramatically between barely running and full power shortly after takeoff he maneuvered during powered surges to align with and land safely on a taxiway at the airport.

No passengers were on board. We had received the weather; I believe it was information S; 32013G20KT 10SM CLR 09/M06 A3027. It also included hazardous winds had been reported and we had heard earlier over ATC that a Hawker had reported windshear loss of 15KTS. I had briefed earlier that if we got a windshear alert that an option would be to climb out and ask for a left downwind to RWY 32; but generally do not use that runway due to its shorter length and pavement conditions. We were cleared for the visual at 6000 MSL. I then set the ASEL to 3000 MSL while still on autopilot. At altitude captured was fully configured; I disconnected the autopilot as I was making the turn to final. We did not receive a hand off to tower until we were turning inbound when [SIC] prompted ATC to switch to tower and were cleared to land. Winds were very gusty. I had set up for the visual RWY26 with a 4 mile final to give me a little extra room to get aligned. I had a little extra power in as I made the turn to final to maintain speed in the gusty conditions and was working the speed down on final as I was descending but it was fluctuating with the gusts and did not want to get too slow. I had quite a bit of left rudder in to counter balance the crab into the wind but I felt I was in control of the aircraft to touchdown. Upon touching down on the runway we caught a gust that brought the right wing up. As I was veering toward the left side of the runway; I was calling to hand the control yoke over to [SIC] so I could utilize the tiller. With the direction angle on the runway and the speed I felt an abrupt right rudder could have side loaded the main and scraped a wing. Once I recognized that I was going to make contact with the grass; I tried to maintain a straight path and bring the aircraft to a stop while avoiding obstacles on the taxiways. I landed at the markers and exited before taxiway K. We came to a stop just after taxiway J. Touchdown was recorded at XA43 local via the FMS. Tower immediately asked if we were okay and if we needed assistance; fire or a tug. We were monitoring the tower and contacting our maintenance personnel to come out to inspect before we did anything. We then shut down the engines and waited for our maintenance to come out with tugs. After they inspected the outside we opened the door and walked around the aircraft. We determined that we would attempt to taxi out of the grass if possible. At that point the Fire personnel arrived and wanted to know if we needed assistance. We declined. We were able to do a normal start and taxi from the grass to the taxiway and then to our hangar. Steering; braking and taxiing all seemed normal. There was minor damage to the left flap and we hit one taxi light. Event was caused by failure to maintain directional control on centerline in gusty conditions. I had made this landing many times over the past 4 years as ZZZ1 is our home base. Options could have been a go around or utilizing RWY 32; but given I had already touchdown; the biggest factor was maintaining directional control.",,"Aircraft drifted left of center line prior to touchdown.

The following is my account of the event; to the best of my memory. After rechecking the weather and NOTAMS at ZZZ1 and ZZZ; I started the aircraft at XA:27 EST. While taxing to runway 23; I turned the TKS system on to the normal setting and noted that the high pressure light was bright yellow. I contacted Center and obtained my clearance. I was cleared as filed; up to 8000 MSL. Prior to my departure; I did one last check of the weather at ZZZ1 and though the ceiling had lowered from the time of my arrival; the temperature was a few degrees above freezing. ZZZ was reporting marginal VFR with 10 miles of Visibility; scattered clouds around 1700 AGL; with overcast around 2000 AGL. I departed at XA:31 EST.I flew the published departure which is a climbing right turn to R270 off of ZZZ1 to 4400 MSL then on course. At 4400 MSL I contacted Center. After several minutes they responded '[Aircraft X]; radar contact; climb to 8000; precede direct HVQ.' My climb was slow and it was difficult to maintain heading and airspeed due to moderate turbulence and a 40+ kt headwind. After passing through 5500 MSL I noticed my groundspeed was 97 kts. Knowing that the winds were stronger above 6000 MSL; I requested from Center to level at 6000. After 4 or 5 minutes at 6000 MSL I noticed my airspeed had dropped from 170 MPH; to 165 MPH. I then took my flashlight and shined it on the wings. The spinner had roughly 2 inches of Rime ice; the props were starting to coat with ice from the root to the edge of the ice strip; [and] the wings were covered from the top to the bottom of the leading edge with about an inch and a half of Rime ice. While inbound to ZZZ1 from ZZZ2; I was able to get on top of the clouds at 10;000 MSL. It was clear above 10;000 MSL to the stars; with negative ice. This was my first out. Also; while inbound to ZZZ1; the freezing rain and sleet turned to rain only while I was passing 4;800 MSL and ZZZ was marginal. That was my second out. Knowing that the wind speeds were higher above 6000 MSL; and seeing how much ice had already accumulated in the amount of time it took for me to climb to 6000 MSL; I determined that the amount of time it would take me to climb to 10;000 MSL; and the rate of which I was accumulating ice; I would not be able to make it to 10;000 feet. At this time I elected to go to my second out and turned the TKS to Maximum. I asked Center how low they could get me and informed them I was picking up ice at a rate faster than I could shed it. The controller then said the lowest he could give me was 5900. I told the controller that I would take it and started down the one hundred feet. The controller then said he could get me lower if I flew a 270 heading for 15 miles. I was hesitant to take it because I knew it would lengthen my time enroute to Charleston but decided to take it after seeing that I was still accumulating ice on the wings and props. The controller then cleared me to an altitude that was only a few hundred feet less. Then; a minute or so later; he cleared me to an altitude less than 5000 and gave me a heading of 300. Several minutes later he asked for a ride report. I grabbed my flashlight again and checked the wings; props; and spinner. The ice had increased since I checked it last; and since turning the TKS to Maximum. I also noted that my airspeed had dropped 10 MPH in the last 5 minutes. I then explained all of this to the controller and he gave me a heading of 310 and said to contact ZZZ and that they would be able to get me lower. I contacted ZZZ and asked if I could get direct to the airport and asked what the lowest he could give me would be. He cleared me direct and said the lowest he could give me was 3500 feet (I think) but said he could get me lower when I got closer. I took the 3500 and noticed that the airspeed was dropping at an alarming rate. I continued towards ZZZ and a couple of minutes later my airspeed was down to 129 MPH. I then told the ZZZ controller that I needed lower. It was then that he declared me an emergency and gave me a descent to 3000. I accepted the clearance and went down to 3000. A few miles further the controller gave me 2200 MSL and I descended. The controller offered me an altitude that would've been 50 feet above the mountains; which I think was 1700 MSL; but I told him I was not going any lower until I was within 10 miles of the airport. Knowing that the temperature at ZZZ1 was above freezing and the elevation is just under 3000; along with the fact that ZZZ was reporting overcast above 2000 AGL and temps above freezing; I thought I would get out of the ice faster than I did. However; it was not until I got a visual of ZZZ that I began to shed the ice. Normally; when the ice begins to come off it sounds like one of the switches on the overhead panel being turned off; or like a circuit breaker popping. This time it sounded more like cannon balls hitting the side of the aircraft. When I was about seven miles south of ZZZ; I was able to call the visual. It took 3 6 second bursts of TKS on the windscreen; and until I was short final for runway 23; for the pilots side of the windscreen to clear. By the time I landed; most of the wings were clear. I landed in ZZZ with no flaps and long at XB:23 EST. The tower had alerted the emergency trucks and they were waiting for me. After I had the aircraft under control on the runway the tower gave me taxi instructions. The trucks followed me to parking. After parking and shutting the aircraft down at XB:24; I got out and was met by the emergency responders. Because the copilots windscreen and the nose were not touched by the TKS; they still had substantial build up. One of the responders asked if the same amount of ice that was on the nose and windscreen was on the wings and I told him yes but it was worse. He then said that was the most ice he had seen on an aircraft that landed. I then answered some questions about my flight from the head responder and gave him my personal information; certificate number; and phone number. I then called my Chief Pilot.",,,,"Aero Commander 500 pilot reported encountering 'severe' icing conditions that resulted in greatly decreased airspeed.",

However; the airplane recently transferred ownership so it was not RVSM approved. We advised ATC prior to our climb; and they cleared us to climb non RVSM to FL410. After we switched controllers a few times; Washington Center asked us to climb to FL430. While in the climb; we noticed our performance deteriorating as we approached the maximum ceiling for the aircraft (FL450). We constantly advised approach that we would need more time to make the climb; and they were fine with the slow climb. Upon reaching our cruise altitude of FL430; the airspeed began dropping and we were only climbing at 100 feet per minute. As we began to level off; the autopilot disengaged and we experienced stick shaker for the first indication of a stall. The pilot flying lowered the nose to prevent a stall; and the aircraft descended 800 feet in the recovery. At this point; we requested FL420 or FL410; but the controller denied it. When we requested a descent to FL280; the controller requested a turn 20 degrees left; but we couldn't turn very quickly with the imminent stall situation. Therefore; we took the turn slowly to be safe.Contributing Factors - the captain had never flown above Fl410 before and high altitude flight/stalls had never been discussed in any of his training. This was my first trip in the Beechjet since I completed my training. Almost all of my training was performed in a simulator below 10;000 feet at low speed flight. Not only was I nervous and overwhelmed with my first trip; but I didn't know what to expect.Actions - The captain noticed the stall indication and immediately reacted accordingly. As the PM; I notified ATC immediately.Inactions - both of us failed to realize that our poor climb performance would affect our ability to level off; maintain altitude; and cruise in turbulence at high altitude.",,"About 10 minutes later the controller asked us if we were able to climb to FL430. We responded that we 'needed a few more minutes at FL410'. Eventually we were asked to climb. Initially the aircraft climb was acceptable; but passing FL420 we were unable to maintain 500 fpm in the climb. As we were leveling at FL430 we encountered turbulence; the airspeed began decreasing; and a stall was imminent. I asked the non-flying pilot to advice ATC that we had to descend immediately due to inability to maintain airspeed and we would take vectors if necessary.Our airspeed was still not increasing rapidly so I initiated a very shallow banked turn. ATC asked why we weren't turning fast enough etc. we were given a number to call. Upon landing at our destination; I contacted the ARTCC manager as advised. He was very nice and explained that we needed to keep them apprised in the future if the aircraft could not perform as expected. He said everything was 'ok'.",,"Two corporate pilots with modest high altitude experience were asked to climb to FL430 for traffic. As they approached their cleared altitude their BE40 would not maintain airspeed nor climb and they had to be vectored off course for traffic and were cleared to descend. 7-800 feet were lost in the maneuver as the turn off course was completed with little bank as the stick shaker was active.",

I departed runway 30 at PWK and was instructed; about one minute after departure; to continue on a 270 heading for one more mile before proceeding on course direct ZZZ. I maintained 2000 feet to remain well clear of the 2500 feet Class B shelf west of PWK. I turned north towards ZZZ about one minute later. At that time I began to climb to 2500 feet to keep a 500 feet buffer to the 3000 feet Class B shelf and increase my altitude above ground for the short flight. Once I was 2 miles outside the PWK Class D I decided to switch frequencies and pick up ATIS at ZZZ to prepare for my approach; as this was the first time I was making a solo VFR flight to ZZZ and wanted to stay well ahead of the airplane. I received ATIS and wrote down the information. When I first tuned the ATIS frequency it was half way through a transmission so I had to listen to it 1.5 times; which I would estimate equated to one to one and a half minutes. When I was done listening I did a scan for traffic and saw the executive jet in a climb about 400 feet in front of me and 200 feet above me. I think the causes of the loss of separation were: - I was level at 2000 feet for about a minute and a half; so even if approach control had given the traffic advisory to the executive jet; they probably assumed I would stay at 2000 feet and not climb to 2500 feet; therefore not recommending any deviation to the executive jet. When I switched back to PWK to report the incident to the tower; the executive jet sounded like it was in the middle of handoff from approach to tower; which added to the lack of communication. Approach; if they had given the advisory; probably said the traffic would pass 500 feet below them when I was in fact climbing. It should be noted that the executive jet was not on final approach to 16 yet and I was not in the final approach path for 16. - I decided to pick up ATIS at ZZZ too early and in a busy terminal environment; when I should have stayed with PWK tower in the interest of receiving traffic advisories. - I was focused on other traffic to my right as I was picking up ATIS and was not as focused on scanning for traffic to my left; which may have allowed me to spot the jet earlier; although the velocity at which it was traveling would make it difficult to spot.",,,,"PA28 pilot reported an NMAC with a business jet in the vicinity of PWK.",

I began trying to assist by calling Seattle Approach on shout and land lines and calling neighboring facilities to have them try as well; but to no luck; we were unable to reach Seattle Approach. During this time; the aircraft descended into Seattle Approach airspace without a handoff. Realizing that something was wrong at Seattle Approach; the controller turned the aircraft away from the airspace so as to cease violating their airspace as quickly as possible. After about 10 minutes of holding the aircraft out; the OMIC declared Seattle Approach ATC Zero and Seattle Center assumed their airspace. At this time; the controller vectored the aircraft towards the Boeing Field ILS13 as requested and I assisted by calling an inbound to the tower. I later learned that this was an incorrect procedure as during Seattle Approach ATC Zero. Seattle Tower actually assumes 10 NM of Seattle Approach airspace up to 5000 MSL. This means that vectoring for the ILS and calling the inbound violated Seattle Tower's airspace because he went through their airspace without a point out or handoff. At the time this was not clear from our brief review of the contingency binder and communication with the OMIC and Seattle Tower.Better briefings on Seattle Approach contingency plans and a much easier checklist for the transition to assuming their airspace.

Aircraft X departed MUVR climbing to FL200; it was reported the estimate was passed to the D26 controller and entered into the system but was entered with an incorrect time.  Aircraft Y departed Miami and was being vectored around traffic and Warning Area W465A to Gran Cayman.  Due to communications failure with Havana and Havana declaring NON-Radar operations no hand-offs were being made between the two facilities.  Aircraft X was not tracked up nor did it auto acquire and a track could not be started as it was on the wrong code.Aircraft passed somewhere north of the TADPO intersection both climbing possibly. Aircraft X noted the Aircraft Y on TCAS and stopped their climb until the aircraft had passed and continued to their assigned altitude of FL200.  Aircraft X was tracked up north of TADPO.  ZMA and Havana experienced a major failure of ADE (data transfer) and MEVA the voice lines between ZMA and Havana.  The only form of communication was the commercial telephone at the Area Desk that then a call could be transferred to a phone at the D26 position.  When I noted that the DATA system was failing I had an A-side join the sector team at R26 and once I realized that the voice lines were not working added a Tracker to the position to help.

The FO then also announced on the interphone the need to set the parking brake. I looked to my left and saw that we weren't moving and told him I was setting my brakes. The tug then rolled forward until it struck the nose of the aircraft. Immediately prior to the tug impacting the aircraft we observed the tug driver attempt to turn the tug to his right. After impacting the aircraft the tug's power briefly vibrated the front of the aircraft. When communication was re-established we learned that they were rushing to find a tug to move the tug off the plane. Rampers were immediately moving about. I made several attempts to get into contact with someone on the ground. Flashed my lights and called on the operations frequency. When communications were re-established we learned that they were rushing to find a tug to move the tug off the plane.

We contacted operations control through ACARS and made an AML entry. Called maintenance operations control shortly after. Communications failed between the ramp and the cockpit.

At the time; a TFR (XYZ) was in effect that included the airspace for arrival Hospital. As per the TFR instructions; I attempted to contact the TFR controlling agency via landline prior to departing. After four attempts of which the line was busy each time; I contacted [company name removed] for assistance. The dispatcher said that he was unable to assist as this is a pilot duty. I then tried the telephone number again and it was still busy. I then contacted Flight Service for their assistance. I explained my situation to the dispatcher and he then put me on hold so he could contact the ZZZ Tower directly. After speaking with the ZZZ Tower; the Flight Service Dispatcher relayed to me that the tower said for me to proceed inbound and to contact them at which time they would give me a discreet code. This is the standard procedure for arriving EMS flights. I then departed and prior to the VFR reporting point southeast of ZZZ I started to contact the ZZZ Tower. While contacting the tower; a military jet passed in front of me then departed back in the direction of the TFR center. The tower gave me a code; said I was radar contact and instructed me to fly the 'East Transition' then direct to the destination. They wanted me to fly the East Transition as this would keep me clear of the TFR center. Approximately 4 minutes from landing; the tower gave me instructions (telephone number) to call them after landing for a 'possible deviation'. After landing; I contacted the tower and explained what happened on my end and what my instructions were from FSS (as they were instructed from the ZZZ Tower). I also called the FSS supervisor to bring him in the loop as to what occurred. I contacted my operations to give him a heads up as to what occurred.I've run this scenario through my head a hundred times trying to figure out what I could have differently. If there was an airspace issue; I would've have thought the tower controller would have queried me at initial contact if I had made telephone contact with the TFR airspace coordinator prior to departing; not after clearing me into the airspace then telling me four minutes out from landing. I keep coming back to that I was following the directions from the FSS dispatcher who got his instructions from the tower. I also ran this scenario by my lead pilot and he would have followed the same course of action. The one area that could have alleviated this issue is that I could have spoken to the tower directly; but then again; hindsight is always 20/20. Also; a more prudent call would've been to contact the [name removed] instead of [company name removed] for potential guidance.",,,,"A pilot calls the correct phone number to attain clearance through a TFR prior to departing.

Our original schedule was to overnight in DSM and do DSM-ZZZ-CLT-ZZZ to finish the trip. The ZZZ flight ended up being cancelled so we sat in the airport for a few hours while our next move was sorted out. We ended up being assigned to take the same aircraft and operate it with passengers to ZZZ1. We loaded up and prepared to pushback. The day before it snowed over a foot in DSM. The aircraft needed type I treatment for frost; and the ramp area was 100% covered in compact snow and ice. DSM de-ice procedures is to do a partial push back; apply fluids engines running; then complete the push. We pushed back halfway out of the gate; started engines; and completed the pre de-ice checklist. We were treated with type I; and the push crew (who was also the de-ice crew) returned to finish the push. When they started to push again; the tug appeared to be spinning out on the ice. The de-ice truck then came over and sprayed a little fluid around the tires of the tug; but the tug still wouldn't move. After about a minute of trying to get the tug loose we heard a loud pop and queried the tug driver what it was; and he said that the '____ pin' (I can't remember what it's called. It's a pin that's designed to break under pressure to preserve the nose gear. I will refer to it as the 'tow bar pin' hereafter). The tow bar pin had broken; so we needed a new tow bar. We decided to disconnect and go get a new tow bar. At this point the captain said 'brake is set'; and motioned to set the brake; and we saw that the brake had been on the whole time. We informed the crew and contacted Maintenance (MX); who came out to inspect the nose gear. It was then realized that the broken tow bar was stuck to the nose gear and they hassled with it for some time before it was finally disconnected. It turns out that it was frozen to the nose gear. Once the broken tow bar was disconnected; MX inspected the nose gear and said that there was nothing wrong with it at all. We connected a new tow bar; finished the push; and completed the flight normally; although we felt rather silly and embarrassed. Although it was our mistake; there were factors that made this mistake much more likely. The pre-ice check includes 'parking brake set'; but the post-ice check makes no mention of the parking brake. This makes sense; since most fluid applications are done while not under tow. However on one of the rare occasions application is done during partial pushback; then it is something you have to remember on your own. The other factor was the icy ramp. Since the ramp was extremely slippery and completely covered in ice; it made perfect sense that the tug would get stuck. Had it been cleared; it would have been extremely obvious to check the parking brake. But with all the ice; that didn't even go through our heads and it wasn't until the captain attempted to set the brake did we see that it was already set. The captain actually said out loud 'brake is released' to the ground crew several times; but the brake was never noticed. Adding a note to the checklist; or adding parking brake would help with avoiding a recurrence. As would extra care in actually checking things; not just saying them. (For both pilots).",,,,"CRJ-900 First Officer reported pushing back on an icy ramp with the brake set; resulting in damage to the tow bar pin.",

Small children basically slide aft and fill up the curvature area of the seatback and the older seatbelts just cannot tighten up enough to hold them in the seat.

On RWY 14; between intersection C3 and C2; the twin prop was suddenly requested to clear the runway. The request was able to be complied with only aggressive usage of brakes; and not without distress due to the closeness of space. The only intersection available before the intersecting runways was C2; the space at that point is confined and less than few hundreds feet.  As the twin prop was aggressively applying brakes to exit RWY 14 the G-IV was on runway 05 decelerating before the two intersecting runways. At the time the Tower gave this unexpected instruction; the twin prop did not have any room left; and any possible evasive action at that point was therefore lost. In case the usage of the full runway length should have been required the result could have been disastrous. The twin prop was cleared to land first and without any restriction. The runway available (14) between touchdown and RWY 05 is less than 2;500 feet.

I noticed that the PILOT ALERT/REVISED SEGMENT said NONE and that the FILED ROUTE segment had a normal looking abbreviation of our route clearance. I happened to check the route in the FMC (which had been automatically up loaded) and noted that it was different from what was shown in the PDC. Upon further investigation; it turned out that the PDC showed '…ZIRKL MCK LNK DSM EVOTE NELLS *** [Destination]'. The FMC and our SABRE flight plan; however; showed …ZIRKL DSM EVOTE NELLS and the rest of the route to destination. We checked with Clearance Delivery and he showed the same thing as the PDC. I called the dispatcher and he said that we had filed what was on the SABRE plan; which did not include the two fixes MCK and LNK. He said he would refile and check with the ATC coordinator and let me know what he found. I stated that I was more interested in resolving the issue for our flight and getting out than researching the problem right now; and he agreed to try to make that happen. We discussed the fact that both routes were very similar fuel wise; so the difference was negligible. We then called Clearance Delivery and negotiated the route that was on SABRE. The Clearance Delivery guy stated that he initially had trouble getting the route to show ZIRKL DSM. He said that ZIRKL MCK LNK DSM was what was filed by the company.The dispatcher said he would make an input to the SABRE people to see what happened. I am concerned that what ATC thought was our filed route was not what we had filed. If the route is changed; it needs to show up in the PILOT ALERT/REVISED SEGMENT part of the PDC.Either what SABRE sent to the ATC computers was not what SABRE should have sent (i.e.; what was on the Dispatcher's screen and what was on my flight plan); or ATC changed the route without telling anyone. Both are problematic. Also turns out we did not file an arrival. When we asked Center about that; they said 'we show you filed Slate Run and the Williamsport Three arrival.'  This is a second; separate change to our flight plan that it was impossible to catch on the PDC due to the 'NELLS***[Destination]' way it was shown on the PDC.

We started taxiing; just after passing Hotel Taxiway; I noticed the red 'APPR 20' sign off to my left; in the vicinity of TWY H; as well as the end of RWY 20; but I never saw the hold line on TWY A for the Approach end of 20. This may have been because my eyes were diverted left to the sign; instead of the pavement; trying to figure out whether it applied to us. The pavement is separated between TWY A; and RWY 20; and the APPR 20 sign is just past TWY H; at an angle; so it was also confusing whether the sign was intended for TWY A or TWY H. In the taxi clearance; controller did not specifically state 'Hold Short Approach end of RWY 20'. While clearly; absence of those instructions does not give us permission to cross a hold line; neither of us SAW the hold line associated with the APPR 20 sign; and we continued. We may have already passed the line at that point. Approaching RWY 14; the controller called us and said; 'In the future; keep in mind you are not allowed to cross the approach end of 20 without permission'; or something to that effect. I immediately checked the chart to see if I had missed something; if there was a note; or a hotspot. There was not. There was no traffic on short final for RWY 20; or in the traffic pattern for RWY 20; so there was no traffic conflict. Looking back on what happened; I think there were two mistakes that happened that day. The controller never issued us the 'Hold Short Approach end of [Runway] 20' instructions; and we missed the hold line. The controller that day admitted that it was busy in the tower at the time; and he may not have given us the instruction. The signage; and angles of the runways and taxiways lead to confusion in that area; as well. Even with the APPR 20 flashing sign; because of the taxiway and runway angles at that spot; and the fact that the pavement on TWY A is totally separate from RWY 20; there was just enough confusion about whether we were supposed to stop or not. In hindsight; I should have stopped to clarify; but we saw no hold short line (in hindsight; we were probably already past it; but did not realize it); so we continued.I called Santa Rosa Tower the following morning to discuss the issue. Apparently; I'm not the only one that has been confused by the signage. When I asked if there was indeed a hold line on TWY A; he said 'Yes; but you probably didn't see if it if you were looking at the sign'. I was told that this happens quite frequently; and that it is a known problem on that area of the field. The controllers have filed multiple safety reports as well about this area. Apparently; the process has been started to get a hot spot note annotated on the chart; and they are looking for ways to make the signage less confusing. One possible idea was to paint the APPR 20 sign on the pavement itself; directly on TWY A; just past TWY H. Maybe the new flashing lights on the taxiway itself would help. Maybe moving the hold line would help; although I can't say that for certain; because I never SAW the hold line. Whatever solution they can come up with to make the signage less confusing in that area would be most welcomed; in the interest of safety. The controller I talked to on the phone also made a note that we weren't given the 'Hold Short' instruction; and said he would pass that along on his end for the controllers to be more vigilant in giving this instruction.",,,,"When the flight crew of Light Transport aircraft was cleared to taxi to Runway 14 via A4 and A at STS they taxied across the extended centerline of the approach to Runway 20.

Weather at the time of the incident; according to the local AWOS; was wind from 140 degrees at 5 knots; visibility 10 NM; sky condition 1;200 ft. scattered; 4;100 ft. overcast; temperature 0 degrees C; dew point 0 degrees C; and altimeter setting of 29.81 inches of mercury. The captain contacted the company flight follower prior departure and was told; 'There is freezing rain aloft; but it is not reaching the surface.' This was in line with the forecast for the area.The forecast suggested that the freezing precipitation would move out of the airport area by arrival time; and that there would be a rising temperature trend such that it would be above freezing at the time of arrival. The flight crew was able to monitor the regional weather while enroute; including radar; using the XM weather feature installed in the aircraft. They were not able; however; to monitor the weather at Airport ZZZ as the AWOS is not connected to the ADDS (Aviation Digital Data Services). Aircraft X does not have a flight phone installed; so the dialup feature of the AWOS could not be used. Also; the crew could not communicate with the company after departure. As the aircraft approached the area; the crew was able to note that the precipitation had moved east of the airport. The AWOS was obtained approximately 50 nm southwest of the airport; and the decision was made to use the RNAV GPS approach to runway XZ in order to land into the wind. The approach was accomplished using radar vectors provided by approach control.[Company X] has a two-step procedure in place for company aircraft arrivals at ZZZ during inclement weather. The crew had utilized the first step of this procedure when they contacted flight following prior to departure for a condition report. The crew used the second step as they approached the airport by attempting contact with ground personnel via radio. Ground personnel use handheld radios to communicate with the crews; and it is not uncommon for crews to be unable to make contact until on about 5 mile final. This was the case on the day of the incident. When the crew made contact they were advised to miss their approach and attempt landing on runway XY; as only the north end of the runway had been sanded in anticipation of a runway XY arrival. This was most likely related to the fact that night landings are not permitted on runway XZ. Most company arrivals at this time of year occur after sunset so the airport routinely applies sand to the north end of the runway only. On the upwind the airport manager informed the crew that he had personally sanded the north end of the runway; but that a snow shower had passed over the field since the sand was placed; leaving fresh; wet snow.The aircraft was then vectored for the RNAV GPS approach to runway XY. The weather south of the airport was VFR and the crew was able to cancel IFR over the FAF. The remainder of the approach and landing were conducted visually. The aircraft landing weight; as provided by the FMS; was 10;290 pounds. This yielded an FMS calculated dry runway landing distance of 2;579 feet. The contaminated runway landing distance for slush or wet snow; from the AFM contaminated runway charts; was 3;800 feet. Declared landing distance for runway XY is 4;352 feet. There is also about 300 feet of pavement north of the departure end of runway XY that was not available for use for landing calculations as noted on the approach chart.Aircraft speed on short final was at V approach (106kt). Touchdown speed was at or slightly above the Vref of 98 knots. The aircraft right main landing gear contacted the ground just at the top of the runway numbers. The left main touched about 100 feet later; and the nose gear about 100 feet after the left main. The touchdown points were determined by inspection of the runway post-incident. Braking was initiated just after nose wheel touchdown. Initial braking action was poor; but the captain felt that; as in the past; braking action would increase upon reaching the sanded portion of the runway. This was not the case. Braking increased marginally in the sanded area; but was not sufficient to bring the aircraft to a stop on the paved portion of the runway. The CJ3 has an anti-skid brake system. Constant pedal pressure throughout the stopping effort is the recommended procedure. Constant pedal pressure was maintained throughout the landing rollout except in three brief instances where it was necessary to momentarily release the brakes in order to maintain directional control. The aircraft departed the end of the paved runway on the runway centerline; and continued approximately 300 feet through a grass clearway area before stopping against the airport perimeter fence. The distance from the nose wheel touchdown point to the aircraft's final resting place is estimated to be around 4;550 feet.The flight crew was uninjured and exited the aircraft without assistance. Damage sustained to the aircraft is limited to several scratches on the windshields and damage to the inboard corners of both flaps.Available performance information suggests that this landing should have been successfully completed. As noted above the contaminated runway landing distance for the prevailing conditions was 3;800 feet. In addition; runway analysis information provided by a [dispatching service company] suggested that the maximum landing weight for prevailing conditions could have been as much as 12;074 pounds; well in excess of the actual landing weight. Therefore; some variable must have existed at the time that would invalidate the performance calculations. The most obvious is that there may have been a thin layer of ice under the snow that was not detected by ground personnel. Airport personnel; along with the author; examined the runway about 90 minutes post-incident; and no ice was present beneath the snow at that time. Weather conditions were changing through this period; however; so it is at least possible that ice was present that subsequently melted. The flight crew would have no way of knowing this prior to touchdown. Another factor to consider in this incident is the action of the anti-skid system on the CJ3. The anti-skid system is supposed to be designed to modulate brake pressure to prevent wheel skid and maximize braking effectiveness through a wide range of conditions. During landing; it becomes active when the wheel speed reaches 59 mph; or 3 seconds after weight on wheels. There is also touchdown protection logic that releases brake pressure until the wheels achieve 59 mph in order to prevent tire damage caused by pilots landing with their feet on the brakes. In the Flight Safety pilot training manual for the CJ3; there is no mention of a time limit for this feature. This raises the question of whether in certain circumstances it may be possible for the antiskid to hinder rather than enhance braking.As has been mentioned earlier; the captain felt that there was some braking. In a discussion with the Director of Operations of Company X; who had witnessed the landing; the Director of Operations mentioned that the aircraft produced 'roostertails' of slush and that what the captain perceived as braking was actually just the effect of viscous friction. The Director of Operations further stated that he felt that; due to the characteristics of the anti-skid system; braking had never actually taken place. His reasoning for this statement was that no snow was piled up in front of the main wheels when the aircraft finally stopped.Several possible mitigations to this situation are as follow. They are not; however; manufacturer recommended procedures and are offered only as suggestions that might be used under the emergency authority provided under the FARs. They are:1. Turn off the antiskid when the speed reaches about 50 knots.2. Shut down the engines in order to kill any residual thrust. (The CJ3 does not possess thrust reverse)3. Raise the flaps when the speed reaches about 50 knots in order to increase weight on wheels and therefore braking effectiveness.",,"On approach to runway XZ was told to contact advisory frequency. Once contacted we were told by the airport manager (who was listening on frequency) that the runway was in better condition to land on runway XY due to recent snow fall. Because the winds were light and variable we were able to land XY. We then went missed and contacted approach control again and told them we would like to land runway XY instead. Again; once we were cleared and told to change to advisory frequency we were reassured that the runway was in fair to good conditions to land and get stopped.The captain was coming into land and I was making my call outs. He was on speed and touched down right on the numbers. Once touched down Captain asked me to select ground flaps. I did what I was told and at that point we were committed to landing; unable to go around. We slid down the runway; as he was unable to get the airplane stopped due to the contamination which the resent snowfall had caused. As a result the captain over ran the runway and we came to a stop a couple hundred feet off the runway. The runway landing distance is 4;352. We calculated the numbers to land on a wet runway prior to landing and there was nothing saying that we could not perform. It was misjudgment on the runway conditions that caused this incident. No significant damage was done to aircraft and procedures for the company are being done to prevent such incidents in the future.",,"A Citation CJ3 aircraft overran the departure end of a Runway in snowy conditions. Actual runway condition was likely misreported. Additionally the anti-skid system may have hurt rather than helped the Captain to bring the aircraft to a stop on the runway.",

The freezing level AIRMET's were all well north and/or east of my route. I filed an IFR flight plan via the coastal route due to lower terrain instead of more inland at 9000 feet thinking this would keep me below the icing forecast altitude and would give more options for cruising at a lower altitude should I encounter icing. As it turned out; I did begin to encounter some very light rime icing at 9000 feet about an hour into my flight. The indicated OAT was -1C but I was in and out of the clouds so was concerned but thought if the problem did not get worse we should be ok. ATC then started vectoring me more east of my route and told me to expect 11000 feet for terrain. I questioned that as the highest MEA was only 7700 feet. I also stated I was had picked up some light rime icing and might need lower if they climbed me to 11000 feet. They said to make my request with the next sector. After the handoff; they kept me at 9000 feet but in the clouds again I was picking up more rime icing so I requested lower. They said they could only give me higher and cleared me to 11000 feet. This put me in between layers with an OAT of -3C so ice accumulation ceased with maybe 1/4 inch on the very leading edges of the wing and struts and 20 knot reduction in airspeed. As soon as the terrain allowed I requested lower and on reaching 7000 feet all of the ice melted off within a few minutes.What I learned: treat the freezing level as a rough guess and expect icing if the cloud bases are anywhere near the freezing level. Don't count on ATC being able to clear you lower; so file lower in the first place. And; lastly; if you don't have much experience flying IFR in IMC then get a live weather briefing from Flight Service. The output of a DUATS or Foreflight briefing presents far more information than you can make sense of sometimes and a weather specialist would have been very helpful to me in deciding on an appropriate altitude and route.",,,,"A C182 pilot filed an IFR flight plan to just below the forecast freezing level and when rime ice started accumulated was initially unable to get cleared to below the freezing level.

The student called in sick and the new FO was a short call on reserve. We were 29 minutes late off the gate due to an ACARS issue that was effecting data flow system wide.  We were holding for hard copies of weights; take off data and runway data when the system came back on line slowly. Normal taxi out and take off except we requested anti-ice on for takeoff due to snow on runway still.After take off and on the climb out we experience a pressurization malfunction. The cabin 'altitude horn' sounded around 13;000 feet in the initial climb out. We reached an altitude of about 14;500 feet as we declared and emergency and where issued a decent to 10;000 feet by ATC. Our 'CABIN ALT' and 'DIFF PRESS' were fluctuating wildly up and down.  Level at 10;000 feet the DIFF PRESS gauge showed 8.6 PSI and a CABIN ALT of 27;500 feet. The Cabin Alt and Diff Press gauge was of no use but we were able to control the CABIN CLIMB gauge with the manual position of the pressurization controller and toggle switch.After we complied with the ORH procedures we made the decision to return. Our aircraft state presented a 'Altitude Horn with forward panel  light' followed by a Pressurization 'Auto Fail' light on both AUTO and ALTN modes and an 'Off Schedule' decent light.  On the return it was discovered the Equipment Cooling Exhaust 'OFF' light had come on too; for both normal and alternate positions.  We never got to make a pilot logbook write up due to maintenance so quickly taking the logbook off the flight deck.  They said that they would handle that specific write up when I told them I had not put it in the logbook yet.Upon discussions with flight attendants it was decided to have EMS services available at the gate upon our return.  The Flight Attendants (FA) said the cabin had become quite hot with several customers complaining about their ears and would like EMS to meet us. The FA's were given the T.E.S.T. and updated several times as well inbound.  Several PA's to the customers from the flight deck and FA's positions where made.We requested a 15 mile final to the ILS in visual conditions to allow for a slow and gradual decent to the airport.  The approach and landing where uneventful.  We had to wait for our gate due to it being occupied.  Ramp did mention that the EMS crews were already at the gate; so they decided to hurry the Aircraft on the gate off and made us wait for a few extra minutes.",,"I was a reserve called at XA00 for a short call. I arrived at the gate an hour prior to departure. I did the preflight which was uneventful. Upon entering the cockpit I started my duties for setting up the aircraft but noticed that the aircraft was not loading the information through ACARS properly. I advised the Captain of this and said I would load the box manually while he discussed the problem with dispatch. Dispatch informed us there was a company wide computer problem and that they were working on it. After a period of time ACARS started functioning properly and we were able to push slightly late. Taxi and takeoff were uneventful but the captain and I decided to use engine anti-ice for the takeoff since the runway still had patches of snow on it. On the climb out passing roughly 14;000 feet the cabin altitude warning sounded. Upon looking at the gauge it made no sense since it was gyrating between a cabin altitude of 7;000 feet and 35;000 feet and a cabin differential which was moving up and down constantly. We immediately decided the best course of action was to stabilize the cabin and declare an emergency. I immediately started a slow descent to 10;000 feet from 14;700 to keep the cabin reasonable while the captain pulled the QRH turned the pressurization switch to man and ran the appropriate checklists. Following the QRH procedures would only stabilize the cabin in Manual mode as the alt pressure gauge was giving an erroneous reading of diff psi 8.7 with a cabin alt of 23;500 feet and an actual plane altitude of 10;000 feet. We both decided that the best course of action would be to immediately return. ATC agreed and we were given priority handling for vectors to the ILS. At this time we were notified by the flight attendants that some passengers were experiencing discomfort with their ears and head. We then asked for a 15 mile final turn in so as to descend at a slow rate for cabin safety and comfort and notified ATC to have paramedics meet us at our gate. We finished the appropriate checklists and landed uneventfully. Even though we had to wait a few minutes for our gate to open up once at the gate we were met with the paramedics and all passenger and crew who wanted treatment were taken care of.",,"B737 flight crew experiences a cabin altitude warning horn passing 13;000 feet during climb with the pressurization control panel displaying false indications of cabin altitude and differential pressure and actual cabin altitude oscillating up and down.

Upon arriving in ZZZ; we were supposed to then rest at some point during the 13 hours we were in the hotel before departing again that night for a redeye segment that left at what would be XA:00am on our body clocks (Eastern Time).  It was simply not possible to get adequate rest given my inability to just fall asleep at any time during a day.  I was able to get about 2 hours of sleep prior to this ANF segment.Upon reporting for duty; the captain and I agreed that we were OK to fly what was a relatively short segment to ZZZ1.  When we arrived at ZZZ1; we were both exhausted.  I was able to fall asleep for about 2 hours upon reaching my hotel room that morning; which ended up being approx XG00-XI00 eastern time.  I was unable to force myself to sleep any further that day prior to our report time that evening.About half way from ZZZ1 toZZZ2 I realized that I was nodding off; making mistakes on ATC communications; and was generally unable to function at an appropriate level due to fatigue resulting from the unworkable rest periods leading up to this segment.  My situation degraded further as the flight continued and we entered the descent approach phase; which was approx XT00 eastern time.  I made multiple mistakes communicating with ATC.  I had a very difficult time remaining alert at even a basic level.

We referenced the QRH Level one alert for the trapped tip fuel and discovered no additional guidance. The low tank warning was a known alert for having less than 3;800lbs. usable.  About that time the tank quantities indicated 7500/3800/8900 respectively. Approximately five minutes after that malfunction we had the #2 start valve open light illuminate.  Soon after; while we initially discussed this malfunction; we both smelled acrid fumes; possibly electrical; on the flight deck. We both donned oxygen masks and established communications over the interphone.  At that time; we declared an emergency with ZZZ Center and determined the nearest suitable divert.  Due to both proximity and winds we determined that ZZZ was the nearest suitable divert.We began the SMOKE/FIRE/FUMES checklist.

This happened very-very quickly. Our position was just prior to the FAF when the event happened; maybe 4 minutes to touch down; then maybe 5 minutes to the gate. We had a hard time afterwards putting the sequence of events together since it was so fast time wise. We were just outside FAF; maybe 8 miles on the approach; had flaps 5 extended; F/O asked for the gear down; complied and armed the speed brake. Shortly afterwards; we both heard a noise; we look at each other; the F/O asked what the noise was; and I said I did not know but it sounded like maybe a door seal leak in back. Got the chime call from the back. I turned up the service interphone knob; said hello; and when the Flight Attendant (F/A) answered I got blasted by a high pitch alarm (F/O instantly turned his off as it was really overpowering). The A F/A told me; having to yell to get above the alarm; that the aft lavatory alarm was going off. I asked her if there was any smoke or fire in the lavatory; she looked into the lavatory and said no. I told her that we will be landing immediately then and she informed the others and returned to her seat. At the same time we got the call from the back; Final App told us to contact tower. Since I was on the interphone with the F/A's; the F/O asked them to standby as we had a problem in the back. After I finished with the F/A's; I got back with the copilot; knew that Final tried to pass us to Tower. I did that; Tower told us we were cleared to land. I then came back to Tower and let them know about the lavatory alarm and that we were going to continue the landing. I asked for the fire trucks to follow us and that we most likely would go to the gate (we had just an alarm; not smoke or fire). He asked another question about the issue; I remember responding but do not remember what was said. We continued to configure and ran the landing checklist. I think the Tower asked us if we wanted to declare an emergency; the F/O confirmed that he would; and I believe I said yes (thank you to whoever it was in the tower that backed us up on declaring an emergency); but neither one of us is sure because we got interrupted with a caution light; looked up and saw that we had an 'equipment cooling exhaust light' (the cooling off) on. We continued with the plan to land. The landing was quite normal except for a pressurization 'bump' that everyone felt in their ears; and another caution light. We looked up and saw that the 'auto fail' light was now on. On landing roll; Tower asked us again if we were declaring an emergency. I said yes; and that we needed to get to the gate to get the fire department on the aircraft to check things out. We transferred controls and exited [the runway].  As we got onto [taxiway]; I looked over towards the fire station and saw that the fire trucks were just exiting their bays; and tower cleared us to cross the center runway. I asked the F/O to contact the F/A's in the back to find out if there was any smoke or fire yet. They said no and informed us they had the fire extinguishers and PBE out and available. Since that was the 2nd confirmation of no smoke or fire and the fire trucks were just approaching the terminal; I decide against stopping and doing an evacuation on the taxiway. As we were crossing the center; tower cleared us across the left runway. As I turned north; the first fire truck heading south passed abeam us. The fire department reported no signs of smoke or fire. This was confirmation #3 that there was no fire; so I elected to continue to the gate. The F/O contacted company and ramp to let them know; and started the APU. I had the F/O tell the F/A's that we were headed to the gate and that I wanted all of passenger's to get off the aircraft in an expedited manner and to leave all of their belongings behind. We got to the gate; ramp was not ready for us (looking for a set of wands) and I kept inching towards the gate. The ramp lead then started noticing all of the fire trucks pulling in behind us and started yelling at his crew. The wands quickly appeared; power was quickly applied; and we shut down the engines and APU; performed the shutdown checklist. I jumped up and opened the door. The controlled evacuation was proceeding in a nice calm manner (no panic and the F/A's doing a great job) but slow (four wheelchairs); several fire department personnel were already in the jet way and ready to get on the aircraft after everyone was out. I also noted at this time that the forward lavatory alarm was activated too. The fire department boarded; found nothing; we reset the alarms. Maintenance (MX) came on; found nothing either. I filled out the MX log book; briefed everyone; made calls to dispatch and the duty officer; then the F/O and I proceeded to our next flight.

Vectored onto a visual final for Runway 28L at about HEMAN; following Aircraft X. We flew the ILS inbound. The preceding Aircraft X appeared to take an inordinate amount to time to clear Runway 28L; exiting I think at taxiway T or K. By now we were within 1.0 nm of threshold. At about 0.75 NM; perhaps even closer; SFO tower cleared another aircraft; Aircraft Y; to 'cross RW 28L'. I believe this aircraft was on E. The aircraft began moving towards; and then onto; RW28L. We were now within 0.5 nm. It was obvious to us that this was not going to work; and we were discussing a go-around. At about 100 feet AGL; Tower directed us to go-around.

At no time were either we; or the other aircraft in any danger. We would have initiated our own go-around within a couple of seconds had the controller not told us to go-around.  Considering that it was a CAVU night; one must wonder what might have happened on a night with reduced visibility if we; and/or SFO Tower; had not been able to see the other aircraft; considering our closeness to the landing threshold.

The videos that are provided for Flight Attendants to review scenarios has incorrect commands being given; does not have the Flight Attendant assessing prior to opening door; one Flight Attendant is out of the jump seat while the plane is still heard crashing; it shows Flight Attendant on the Airbus standing blocking the pilots from coming out of the cockpit and show several who are yelling for passengers to come this way prior to ensure that the aircraft door is fully opened and locked to aircraft. Although this may appear that I am being picky; yet these videos are being provided as guidance to assist us in our proficiency for when we are tested on our aircraft doors. One of the video scenarios needs to be explained. We were told after others had issues during practice; that it was to simulate a bird strike; instead instructors had to advise us that we were getting up while the aircraft was still in flight this resulted in frustration for Flight Attendants who were about to be tested on their door skills. The scenario needs to be explained prior to the drills or needs to be changed. Also in the video audio; you can hear commands being yelled in the background; this was also heard while I was doing my door drill. Adding goggles for door testing is an accident waiting to happen. We are told that we are being tested on our proficiency; how can I be tested on proficiency on something that I have never used before? It is important to note that the goggles vary in darkness; the one I had for my door drill allowed me to make out outlines and shapes but my depth perception was off. The goggles were given to us after we had sat down and were strapped into the jump seat. So when I get up to open the door in emergency mode; I blindly felt around trying to find the assist strap and came close to the edge of the platform that the door sits on which is several inches off the floor. Please STOP the door testing with the goggles it is extremely unsafe. I do believe that they were useful during the firefighting and recommend that they continue to be used for these types of training simulations; but only when Flight Attendants are being tested and when their actions are more controlled. The goggles I had for firefighting were extremely dark; I could not make out what was directly in front of me. The video used in the firefighting is problematic as it once again contradicts prior training and information that we are to fight the fire by aiming the fire extinguisher at the base of the fire. In the video it shows a Flight Attendant fighting a fire from behind the oven door and NOT looking into the oven; so they were unaware where the base of the fire was. It is disappointing that something that is being provided to assist us in training does not accurately depict what we have been trained; this places the aircraft; passengers and crew at risk. My group had a lot of sit time; and the class went over; the instructors were great but I believe that the content needs to be reviewed. I was disappointed that there was no mention that one infant had already been saved by Flight Attendant or information about a recent decompression that I heard that occurred. In the past; the instructors always relayed this kind of information; made the training current and relevant. I am disappointed in the recent class and hope that my feedback will be considered to improve this one as well as future classes.",,"This report is to address concern that I have regarding training; this is the second time that I have received training information inflight that differs significantly from my FAOM. In the most recent training there is a class titled; commanding exits. During this training we were advised of new Inflight procedure that contradicts all my previous safety training. We were told that when two Flight Attendants are at dual exits and one of the doors is blocked that the one with the blocked exit is to lower our voice while yelling evacuation commands because it confuses the passengers. They also advised that we should try not to use the command 'exit blocked' and instead use directional commands. It unrealistic to expect anyone to be able to lower their voice during an evacuation and doing so could actually hinder the evacuation. Secondly; to advise a Flight Attendant to try and not use the command 'exit blocked' is contrary to what we have been taught. If a passenger is at a door that is open but unusable door and the Flight Attendant does not make it clear that the door is not usable and provide directional commands to the passenger; I believe that the passengers will disregard the Flight Attendant and try to use the unusable exit and put themselves and others at risk. I am surprised that FAA would allow this information in training; especially since for the last 8 years it has been FAA who made us have not only timed evacuations that ensured that we yelled in a urgent; authoritative manner and were timed opening doors. Please reevaluate this training as I believe that it places passengers and Flight Attendants at risk during an evacuation. The second part of training that conflicts with my FAOM is that we keep being told to inform not enforce; but my FAOM says to ensure.",,"Flight Attendants do not believe that their current ground school training philosophy is in compliance with the flight Attendant manual procedures.",

I am also aware that maintenance on the same extinguisher deployment lines occurred after me and before the lines were said to be discovered incorrectly routed. I removed and replaced the Number-Two fire extinguisher bottle as a result of a low pressure indication in the cockpit. I performed this maintenance task at the standards which I have practiced all of my career. At no time in my career have I ever knowingly performed tasks counter to written procedures. My approach to my work has always been of a serious nature treating each task as if my own family's life depended on it. To the best of my recollection I installed the lines as the figure showed them to be and I was reassured when the very large flex lines aligned for fitting. I am aware however that the improper routing of these lines can have very serious consequences.  Graveyard.","Reporter stated that part of the fire bottle installation includes a specific leak check that pressurizes the large metal braided discharge flex lines that connect to each fire bottle. There are only two fire bottles (total) that supply fire extinguishing for the left and right engines and APU. The large flex lines are disconnected and pressurized air is applied to each line routed from each fire bottle to the left or right engine discharge nozzles in each engine compartment. The exit nozzles are also capped off during the test. The purpose is to verify that no leaks occur in the discharge lines that reduce the available fire extinguishing agent.Reporter stated he could not accomplish the leak test of the discharge lines because his station did not have the proper equipment to perform the test. He believes that either the Maintenance Manual or some other document allowed for the leak test to be deferred for a period of time. The leak check was actually accomplished later at a different Maintenance Station. Not until the MD-83 was brought into one of their Base Maintenance Stations did the crossed-connections of the fire bottle large flex lines become known. Had an engine fire occurred with the cross-connections he's not sure if each engine would have had only one fire bottle available; or if discharge would have gone to the engine not on fire.",,,"An Aircraft Maintenance Technician (AMT) was inform by his Quality Assurance department that he may have incorrectly routed the # 2 Fire Extinguisher bottle discharge lines on an MD-83 aircraft.

The weather was predicted to be 1;500 feet ceilings and windy. This was from a station near DUX as they don't have weather reporting. I had enough fuel for my trip and 1hr reserve. As I was descending to DUX I got a report on AWOS vis 7nm and 500 feet OVC. I listened to BGD which is just east of DUX and they were reporting 7nm and 1;200 feet OVC. I asked Approach if they had the weather for DUX and they said it was 10nm and clear. It looked to me that it was IFR and the tops were low but probably the same as DUX. I thought about going to AMA instead as it looked VMC there but I couldn't tell from my distance. I did know that it was VMC somewhere south of me. I asked to change my destination to BGD and the GPS approach and got the AWOS one more time. It was 6nm and 800 feet OVC. I decided to shoot the approach as it was above my minimums. I also was slightly concerned about my fuel as I didn't want to make another approach if I missed. I was still OK with the reserve I had. On the approach; I didn't see the runway until right over it and did a missed approach as the ceilings were much lower than anticipated. However; I was hand flying the plane and climbing north as the missed indicated but I couldn't get Approach. I tried several times. I then realized when I switched to Approach from Unicom; I must have double tapped the flip-flop and I was still on Unicom. I was climbing through 4;700 feet and in VMC conditions. I was concerned about my fuel and trying to figure out my next airport. I discovered and corrected my radio problem and called Approach. By his time I told them I was heading to AMA. I had not completed the missed approach procedures and they assigned me an altitude and gave me clearance to AMA at 7;000 feet. To make matters worse; I put in the wrong altitude and climbed above my clearance. There were a couple of planes in the area holding above me and I realized the problem of my actions. While I never felt unsafe in my approach; I certainly was preoccupied with my decisions and procedures and failed to follow the missed approach procedure. I think part of the problem was that I passed my first destination to my second where I missed the approach and then was nervous about my fuel and going to my third airport. The controllers did say the front moved in much faster than anticipated which explains why I was expecting better conditions at both DUX and BGD but saw low ceilings. The AWOS was more accurate than Approach.

I descended Aircraft X to FL330.  Aircraft X read back what I thought was FL 330; and then Aircraft X asked if that was 'Pilot discretion.'   I said 'Negative'; but did not restate the altitude because I thought the read back was correct.  Aircraft X then reported leaving FL350 for FL230.  I heard FL330.  I put Aircraft X on ZLA's frequency.  Aircraft X was descended to FL330 for procedures going into ZLA.   I was working 11 aircrafts in the sector to the north of this incident.  I had a D-side. I did observe Aircraft X at FL330 just before crossing the ZLA boundary.  It would have showed this for about 600 feet while descending.  At the ZLA boundary the Conflict Alert (CA) activated between Aircraft X and Aircraft Y; northwest bound at FL320.  I made a comment to my D-side questioning if maybe I issued FL310 instead of FL330.  My D-side thought that we issued the correct altitude.  It appeared that ZLA turned Aircraft X to the east; but it was a small turn.My 1st mistake was not hearing the readback.  My 2nd mistake was not reissuing FL330 after the pilot asked for 'Pilot's discretion.'  It did cross my mind.  I missed the 2nd read back; also. I should have called in sick.  I don't hear as well as I used to and don't deal with distractions as well; either.  The new control rooms for Display System Replacement (DSR) are very noisy compared to the old Main Display Monitor (MDM) control room.  I transferred to ZOA just over 2 years ago.  The DSR control room in ZOA is designed differently than the DSR control room in ZLC.  The 4 most used sectors are all up against the wall.  When training; there can be as many as 16 people in that small area.  I mentioned this in a previous report.  You can hear every clearance and conversation.  It is very noisy for an old controller.  Also; we have had radio problems with the MVA; specific transmitter site location; transmitter for days.  The radios are not very clear.  It sounds much clearer when listening to the playback than at the sector.  I had 2 breaks early in the shift; but did not eat anything because I thought I would get another break soon.  That was a mistake because I was feeling weak and unreadable towards the end of that session.  We were on the southeast plan for bay area arrivals and almost every aircraft needed to be re-cleared via a new arrival.  We also had some complex traffic situations earlier and I was feeling tired.  This is not an excuse.  I think it is time to retire.",,"Aircraft X was a Las Vegas arrival at FL350 and was required by ZLA to descend to FL330 as per LOA. The sector was unusually busy that day being on a southeast arrival plan to SFO and the Bay Area; which meant we were issuing a different arrival to every single plane that checks in on frequency; and updating each one's route; while maintaining separation; sequence; and avoiding active military airspace in the sector. We also had turbulent rides which made flights change altitudes repeatedly.  My R-side issued Aircraft X a descent clearance to FL330; in which I did not catch the read back because I was trying to keep up with checking routes and making helping the R-side separate incoming traffic. The R-side switched Aircraft X to ZLA; then shortly we noticed Aircraft X descending through FL330 while Aircraft Y was opposite direction at FL320. I wanted to call ZLA but we saw the targets vectored so I assumed they had made a mistake issuing a descent and turned both aircraft. I found out later from my supervisor that me and my R-side had missed the readback on Aircraft X and had taken a descent to FL230.The sector was busy at the time with the R-side sequencing; separating traffic; changing altitudes for the bad rides; and issuing routes while the D-side had to keep up with updating the routes and making coordination. ZLC is required to have all bay area arrivals on a west arrival route as default. I think if the proper routes were issued ahead of time instead of depending on ZOA to issue all of it and do the sequencing it may alleviate and lift some of the workload from both the R-side and D-side which in turn can focus on making sure everything is separated and be more focused on catching read backs.",,"ZOA Controller describes a read back hear back issue resulting in an aircraft descending lower than the Controller wanted.

We departed with the main tanks full and 1;700 pounds in the center tank.  When I noticed the imbalance; the tanks read: number one 11.8; number two 10.6 and 400 in the center.  We considered the fact that it was a gauge problem; or possibly that fuel was being transferred from the center into the wing tank.  I turned off the center tank pumps and began cross-feeding to get within limits. During this time we analyzed the fuel system schematic and considered that the center tank scavenge jet pump might have malfunctioned and was allowing fuel to transfer from the center tank to the number one tank.  Once the fuel was balanced; I turned on the center tank pumps to burn the last 400 pounds and again and saw the number one tank fuel quantity start to increase. During this time there was roughly a 500 pound imbalance after the center tank was depleted. I centered that imbalance one last time through cross feeding.  We went into the QRH for guidance and additional information.  The fuel burns were close; the pumps were configured correctly; cross-feed valve was operating correctly; and the fuel audit revealed us arriving with more fuel than planned into ZZZ; thus discrediting the possibility of a fuel leak.  We did decide to time for 30 minutes per the QRH to verify the imbalance was less than 500 pounds.  After 30 minutes; the imbalance was negligible.  We continued on to ZZZ with the fuel gauges matched and no abnormal indications.  We sent a MX request regarding the issue; and asked them to meet us at the gate.  Prior to TOD it was determined that we would be overweight slightly for landing.  We configured early and requested delay vectors from ATC to burn off the extra fuel.  After a period of time in which the Fuel On Board (FOB) indication should have come down enough for landing; we noted the number one main tank again increasing in quantity.  At this point; once again questioning the accuracy of the fuel gauge; we decided to expeditiously land and deal with the fuel issue at the gate.  We requested and were cleared for the visual approach.After an uneventful landing; the number one fuel quantity indicator began to fluctuate between 1;200 and 4;000 pounds and the number two gauge was at 4;000 pounds.  Parked at the gate; the gauges read: number one 1;000; and number two 3;900.  We coordinated with ZZZ Ops and had the Fuelers standby until Maintenance had a chance to troubleshoot the problem.  Maintenance showed up and verified that both the flight deck gauge and the wing gauge matched.  Sticking the wing tanks confirmed that this was in fact the current fuel quantity.  Maintenance then MEL'd the fuel gauge in the logbook and we observed the fueling process sticking the tanks; as per the MEL; with an Info Only write-up for the (M) procedure in the logbook.I truly believe that expectation bias was a major factor leading to this issue.  For years I have cross-fed fuel using the same procedure; with the same outcome.  This was no different.  As I cross-fed; the gauges reacted as expected.  The problem was the rate that I was transferring was greater than that indicated due to the malfunctioning gauge.  After I thought we had 'fixed' the problem; the gauges seemed to be responding correctly and were matched; my thoughts drifted from the original issue.  I also feel that my 'outside the box' analysis of a possible malfunctioning center tank jet scavenge pump should have been avoided.  The fact that the number one tank increased by the amount of fuel in the center tank each time the center pumps were turned on was pure coincidence.  Adhering to strict QRH checklist discipline would have prevented this.  Hindsight is 20/20 and it's much easier to evaluate my actions now.  The chain should have been broken early with the detection of a fuel quantity greater than the tank capacity.  This thought did cross my mind; but the responseto the action that I used (cross feeding to balance) gave me the result that I expected; expectation bias.The main action that I will institute after this event is a thorough analysis before I crossfeed fuel.  The givens are fuel flow in pounds per hour versus how many pounds to match the tanks.  With this information you can obviously predetermine a time.  There is no doubt in my mind that I will time each crossfeed operation from now on.  I will also involve Dispatch and Maintenance Control early on in a complex event such as this.  My plan was to contact them after the 30 minute timing (per the QRH) if there was a fuel imbalance.  There was not.  Contacting them early on would possibly have changed my mindset toward the issue and given justification for allowing the presumed imbalance.  The last item is checklist discipline.  Even though I had a presumed action that would rectify the problem based on experience; I should have referred to the QRH initially (even for something as routine as balancing fuel).  This could have been the break in the chain that would have determined a different outcome.",,"I suspect that there may have been a cumulative fuel imbalance occurring for a few legs prior to us receiving the aircraft which went unnoticed by us; the fuelers; or previous Crews. All fuel audits were performed by us and our Agents and appeared normal. But with misleading information on the gauges it is possible that there was never the appropriate amount of fuel in the left main tank even though it indicated full.I feel that the Captain and I worked well as a Team; and used all available resources to bring the aircraft safely to the gate. The only possible suggestion I have to prevent this in the future; besides drip sticking the tanks between every flight (which I know would be impractical; is to publish a table in the QRH; or appropriate manual which lists the fuel flow; and time to balance 200 pounds; 500 pounds; and 1;000 pounds; or something similar so we can time how long we transfer fuel; and know about how much should be transferring so Pilots can cross-check that with the indication system. I know that may be reaching a bit; but that may have been helpful to us in that particular situation.",,"B737 flight crew reported difficulty accurately trouble shooting a malfunctioning fuel gauge.",

Shortly thereafter Approach asked us if we had the airport in sight; and then cleared us for the visual approach to 10L and switched us to Tower frequency.  The FO was initially heading too far to the east; but then corrected back towards a five mile final/base.  As the FO turned base; there was a small cloud bank between us and the airport that we had not previously observed.  The FO maneuvered around the clouds and then lined up on the runway on speed; and on glide path.

We were descending on the ZZZ RNAV Arrival when Approach Control affirmed that we had the airport in sight and cleared us for the Visual to 10L. We entered 10L into the FMS with a five mile fix off the approach end. I still had it in my head that we were landing west; so instead of turning base; I disengaged the autopilot and started to fly a downwind leg. I quickly realized my mistake and informed the Captain. He set my navigation to proceed direct to the five mile fix off 10L and I turned the aircraft to proceed to that fix. I focused my attention on the instruments; making sure I was at the correct speed and descent rate while navigating to the fix. When I looked back outside; the airport was obscured by a scattered cloud layer. We navigated around it; and saw the runway which had its approach lighting system on bright. I checked my instrumentation; which showed no lateral or vertical deviations. We were stabilized; on VASI; and proceeded with an uneventful landing. We were cleared off the runway by Tower and then cleared by Ground Control to the gate. It was only after we had parked that I realized that we had landed on 10R.

In the engine compacted mode; on the upper EICAS screen; which seems to be the SOP on the 777; there is no scale for engine vibration; just a number; so; I didn't worry about it; (much). After coming back to the cockpit from my break; about an hour and 10 minutes from destination; I noticed a note on the center pedestal from maintenance inquiring about the health of our #1 engine. After consulting with my crew; they assured me the engine the engine had been running fine the entire time I was on my break. Indeed the engine ran perfectly; and indicated normally; except for the engine vibration indication; during the remainder of the cruise; descent; approach and landing. During taxi in; we had to stop before turning into the gate. When I added power to turn into the gate; we heard a loud rubbing sound; and vibration from the #1 engine; which got louder and more pronounced when I shut the engine down. The mechanic then got on the headset; and said;'you broke it; we will have to replace the engine'. The next day; the mechanic told my flying first officer; 'I am surprised they didn't turn you back to departure airport' with the condition of that engine. It was very interesting to learn that maintenance knows more about the condition of the engines on my airplane than the flight crew does.",,,,"B777 Captain on an international overwater flight reported he experienced an engine failure on taxi in at destination. Reporter commented that maintenance was watching the engine with some concern; but the only cockpit indication of a problem was slightly elevated engine vibration indication.",

They sent a message in their response to our in-range report that they wanted me; as captain; to sign the weight and balance worksheet. I looked in Vol 1 and couldn't find any provision for this. I looked at the weight and balance worksheet and don't think I'd be in a position to sign the form because short of supervising the entire loading process; I really have no way to know if the conditions are met to truthfully sign the affirmation near the signature line on the weight and balance worksheet. The signature line is also labeled 'Loadmaster' which I am not.Vol 1 has a section that is titled 'When Loadmaster is Not Available'; but it isn't very clear. I couldn't see any provision allowing the captain to sign the Load Worksheet. Our ACARS worked so we ran the standard AWP solution and that came out just fine--legal for flight and within limits. As a belt-and-suspenders move; I went ahead and called Central Load Planning and had them run a computer-generated weight and balance. I signed one copy of the computer generated weight and balance and left it with the station. I did this because I thought it was important to have *some* form of paper weight and balance signed and left with the station.This situation concerns me on several levels:1.  It seems to me that I've been told by memo or somewhere in the training process that I MUST have a signed weight and balance worksheet in my possession before leaving the gate. Unfortunately; I cannot find this requirement in our official policy and procedure manual--VOL 1. If this is a requirement; I think it should be clearly stated in the manuals and not just appear in memos.2.  The VOL 1 instructions for using Centralized Load Planning seem to contradict my understanding that we MUST have a signed weight and balance worksheet.3.  The station manager seemed to think that sending an ACARS message to the inbound crew was sufficient to change Company procedure. He was confused and slightly perturbed that I went through the process of contacting Centralized Load Planning and did not want to sign the weight and balance load worksheet. If we are going to outsource everything related to the operation of this airline; there ought to be a clear training program for the contractors and they ought to be supervised by a Frontier representative--someone other than the captain--because it's unreasonable to expect me to know every rule and policy regarding station operations.I realize we're trying to outsource the entire operation; but where does safety come in? I would think that we should have at least one Frontier employee on duty at each station whenever a Frontier flight is operating to monitor the situation and ensure company policies and procedures are being followed. I think it is unreasonable to expect the flight crew to act in a supervisory capacity with regard to station operations. A flight crew only has so much time and only so much bandwidth. Expecting me to know and manage the station operations means I have less time to devote to the management and operation of the aircraft and the crew. Something has to give. At some point the flight crew WILL become sufficiently task saturated and safety will be compromised.

A ramp employee confirmed that the packs and the external air cart had ran all night together.  The first officer had arrived 5 minutes before the rest of the crew and was unable to enter the cockpit because the door was closed and locked.  After a few knocks the keypad was used and the door unlocked and there was an individual in a sleeping bag laying on the floor; and he was just awaking.

At this time it became evident that the aircraft had been deiced at the gate (full body) without being properly configured.  Maintenance was called on the phone to defer another item; but I also asked about the deicing. If the aircraft is going to be deiced there is a specific checklist to use to configure the aircraft.  If this station is allowing the aircraft to be deiced at the gate prior to the crew arriving there should be a procedure to make sure our procedures are being followed. This also applies to the deice vendor; they also have a responsibility to make sure an aircraft is properly configured prior to spraying it.  If we are going to have all contract personnel; at all our stations; we need some accountability; training and some supervision.

Climb and maintain 4000 feet; expect FL220 in 10 minutes.  ONT Tower cleared us for takeoff from runway 26L with instructions to maintain 3;000 feet on departure.  Prior to takeoff; we waited holding short of 26L for a Heavy to clear runway 26L.  That aircraft had been back taxiing 26L and was positioned behind our aircraft on taxiway S.After takeoff; ONT Tower handed us off to SoCal Approach.  Shortly after checking in with SoCal; the controller cleared us direct POM VOR direct VNY VOR.  Neither waypoint was in the cleared route.  I told the approach controller that information.  Controller responded again with cleared direct POM and an instruction for after POM that I did not fully hear.  At some point conttroller also cleared us from 3;000 feet to 8;000 feet and wanted us to expedite.POM VOR was not part of the cleared route; and therefore it was neither in the GPS flight plan nor tuned into the NAV radio receiver.  Programming the new clearance required a few seconds of time and that seemed to annoy the approach controller.  After getting POM programmed into the GPS and directing the aircraft toward the POM VOR; I queried the controller for the next waypoint clearance.  I understood that after the POM VOR; I was to fly heading 280 to join V459.After getting the POM VOR programmed into the GPS; I was attempting to clean up the remainder of the programmed flight plan when the aircraft (on autopilot and NAV mode engaged) began a left turn to the next waypoint in the GPS which happened to be a point on V186 which was south of the aircraft's position.  The GPS had cycled to the next waypoint; and the turn prediction component of the navigation software lead the turn.  I quickly directed the aircraft back to the POM VOR using HDG mode and after POM turned to heading 280 as instructed.Receiving a new clearance shortly after takeoff is unsafe when it requires new programming of navigation equipment.  A safer solution from the controller would have been to provide a radar vector.  I cannot recall ever receiving a re-route just two minutes after departure while still on an initial assigned departure heading.  The first waypoint of the new clearance (POM VOR) was so close that there was very little time to get the new route programmed before passing that first waypoint (POM VOR) of the new clearance.I suspect that the approach controller had the Heavy departing right behind us; and that approach wanted [us] out of the path of the faster jet. The SoCal approach facility and the ONT Tower should have better coordinated the departures; and SoCal Approach should have been aware of the route on which [we] had been cleared.  SoCal Approach seemed quite confused and overwhelmed.  For my part; I should have simply asked SoCal approach for a radar vector (heading) when it became clear that the controller and I had differing route expectations.I suspect that the original clearance received on the ground from ONT Clearance Delivery was not what the SoCal Approach Controller was expecting because the original clearance received on the ground did not include the POM V264 information.  Again; to reiterate; the POM V264 information was not communicated as part of the IFR clearance received while on the ground.

Due to the amount of traffic congesting the radios and being distracted flying the plane with the simulated engine out; I was unable to make another pattern call until we were midfield left downwind for runway 35. I heard a call that stated that someone was on left downwind but did not completely hear who they were. After asking the left downwind traffic to repeat; they stated that were at 4;800 feet; a helicopter; and that we were directly overhead. During the downwind phase of the flight our altitude varied from 4;950 to about 5;100. I was able to see the helicopter below us after we passed it off of the rear left side. The examiner was not able to view the helicopter. This helicopter was being used to provide flight training from a different flight school at the airport. The helicopter traffic was unknown to us until we had passed the aircraft; therefore we did not take extreme corrective action but increased altitude slightly. I believe that due to having the left engine failed upon beginning to circle and having a large volume of traffic calls; the examiner and I were unable to distinguish helicopter position calls and find the helicopter operating below the normal airplane flight pattern.",,,,"Light twin pilot receiving instruction reported an NMAC with a helicopter in the pattern at LGU.",

The Pilot Flying entered the Runway and ILS 04 in the FMS while I checked the chart.  While comparing the waypoints he mentioned that the FMS had us going over TROOP and CRISS intersections. At first glance I thought runway 4 would take us over the southern arrival gate using POYIG and BERNE; then saw the note at CRISS that listed Runways 4; 12R; 30L so I agreed we would be using CRISS.  Shortly; the approach controller asked if we were on the RWY 4 arrival course and I confirmed we were and expecting RWY 4. He came back in a minute and gave us a heading.  I thought that might mean we were on the wrong one so I checked again and noticed that the note at CRISS stated 'LANDING OTHER THAN SAN ANTONIO INT'L RWYS 4; 12R; 30L'. I asked if we should rejoin and we were cleared to.Then we had to resolve why the FMS had kept the wrong transition points. We don't know exactly but I found that to get the correct ones I not only had to enter the RWY and APPROACH but if I selected the STAR that it changed the waypoints to the correct transition.  It is now my conclusion that when the flight plan was filed; the RODIO2 was filed without a runway; but the CRISS arrival transition was in the flight plan. We were cleared as filed so these remained in the flight plan as it was loaded in the FMS.  The waypoints were correct but the RODIO2 was not in the FMS as a STAR; merely as waypoints that were chosen from the flight planning software for filing.My mistake was obvious (misreading the note) but aggravated and allowed by the FMS issue which caused me to believe my mistake.  I would think that avoiding words like 'OTHER THAN' would avoid missing this negative reference to the runways that are NOT intended.",,,,"A flight crew discovered that their FMS had kept the wrong transition points for their arrival runway.

During the entire session the trainee consistently placed aircraft into head-on situations while putting them at the same altitude.

We had reviewed the arrival separately as per the new [revised] separate [briefing] procedures. However we did verbalize that we each had reviewed the fixes. We had also verbally review the approach for runway 36R. I think we were outside of MSTRD level at 220. The first descent restriction I remember as visible on map was ROYOS. I do not remember seeing a white arrow. Although we both verbalized an agreement to the 'bottom' being 6000; we did not verbalize a warning as to not beginning the decent before KIYEN and I do not remember even having the thought go through my head. We did both verbalize we need to pay attention--this IVANE will bite you--but other than that; no verbalization as when to engage NAV descent mode.As soon as clearance was received I engaged descent mode. When we had descended about 1000 feet the controller asked us to stop the descent at 200. Then we verbalized the fact that they were landing south instead so I entered Runway 18L and it popped up all the altitudes and restrictions that were not visible before. Even when they were higher than our current altitude. Then I wondered why the controller stopped our descent and looked again at the arrival plate. Then I realized what I had done wrong. We did ask controller if we had a problem. He said 'I didn't expect you to start down so soon'. The new verification procedures might have been a larger problem. If we had been going over it like before the person looking at the plate would have verbalized the higher restrictions and the other person would likely started a discussion about it. Then one of us would most probably have remembered earlier about the gotcha on starting down.","The Captain clarified the references to the company's newly implemented 'separate' briefing procedures for RNAV STARs; a unique; required briefing introduced by the carrier when the new complex STARs began to generate deviations. The company's original procedure; which reporter preferred; was for one pilot to review the chart and its restrictions aloud using the applicable paper (and later iPad displayed) chart and the other pilot to confirm that data with the programmed but not yet activated moving map display. The recently introduced revision requires only that each pilot 'review' the procedure and merely advise one another they had done so.Reporter further discussed the fact that; when the aircraft is already at or below the lowest crossing altitude of any waypoint in a STAR; the altitude restrictions drop out entirely as the FMC considers them to have been satisfied. Unfortunately; this protocol is inappropriate when the altitude of the aircraft is 'at' the altitude that must be crossed 'at or above'; as in the case of KIYEN on the IVANE STAR. When the crossing restriction drops out of the FMC prior to the aircraft crossing the waypoint there is nothing to prevent the automation from descending prior to satisfying the 'at' requirement.The trigger for the potential deviation is the engagement of the Managed Descent mode prior to crossing the waypoint...such as might happen when a flight crew is cleared to 'descend via' the arrival which originally included the restriction. Per the Captain; when Managed descent is engaged in such a situation the aircraft will begin a 1000 FPM descent so as to cross the 'next' restricted fix at the most efficient point in a window or 'at' a single altitude restriction.","An A319 flight crew; level at FL220 near MSTRD and cleared via the IVANE RNAV STAR to CLT; was cleared to 'descend via' the arrival and the flight crew selected managed descent after confirming that each had reviewed the procedure; its restrictions and had determined and set the 'bottom altitude' for the procedure as 6;000 MSL. The aircraft then began a descent to cross ROYOS between FL230 and FL190 as charted; but failed to meet the requirement to cross the active waypoint; KIYEN; at or above FL220 as restricted.",

Aircraft X was descending on the JAIKE3 arrival.  As the aircraft was approaching the boundary with N90; I noticed that N90 Metro sector had not accepted the handoff.  I called Metro on the line for a handoff.  The Metro controller answered the line and stated that they were on the JFK radar site and couldn't see my traffic.  He stated that I should have already gotten the word on that.  I had not been advised of this; or any short-term procedure for dealing with it.  Anyway; since my aircraft was now entering N90's airspace; I requested permission from the Metro controller to enter his airspace.  The N90 Metro controller approved that request and I allowed Aircraft X to continue on the route into N90's airspace.  A few miles into N90 airspace; the controller accepted the automated handoff and I transferred communications.A few minutes later Aircraft Y was descending on the JAIKE3 arrival.  I called METRO when the aircraft was 15 miles from the boundary and requested permission to enter N90 airspace with Aircraft X.  The controller said okay.  I entered N90 airspace with Aircraft X and a few miles into their airspace the N90 controller accepted the automated handoff.  I transferred communications at that time.There is no procedure in the PHL/N90 LOA that deals with this issue between these 2 sectors.  We do have a 'Late Handoff Procedure' that deals with other sectors; for traffic transiting via RBV; but it does not address traffic between the PHL North High and Yardley sectors and the N90 METRO and Yardley sectors.  In other words; there is no late handoff procedure for JAIKE or V3 traffic.I spoke to the supervisor and the OM about how we should be handling the JAIKE and V3 traffic today; since N90 cannot see the traffic until it is in their airspace.  OM advised that we will use non-radar procedures with traffic on these routes.  I made a request of my OM and PHL TMU for 20 miles-in-trail from ZDC on traffic entering my airspace on the JAIKE3 arrival.  My request was denied; with no reason given.1.  'Late Handoff Procedures' do not currently exist for the sectors/routes described above (V3/JAIKE3/MAZIE2/V214 traffic).  There seems to be some confusion among N90 and PHL controllers regarding this fact.  Since we do have 'Late Handoff Procedures' for RBV traffic; I think that many controllers; FLMs; and OMs at both facilities assume that we also have them for other sectors/routes.  We do not.  This needs to be re-briefed to the workforce; including management.2.  'Late Handoff Procedures' should be developed jointly between N90 and PHL to address the sectors/routes above; to deal with instances when N90 is using backup radar.3.  N90 should adopt fused mode to provide them with adequate radar coverage of their entire airspace.4.  In the absence of #3 and #2 above; PHL airspace should be extended 5 miles to the east along the boundary with Metro.  PHL currently uses fused mode which provides much better radar coverage in this area than N90 currently has.  In the event that PHL loses fused mode for some reason; the PHL and the NXX radar sites still provide very good radar coverage in this location.5.  In the absence of #2; #3; and #4 above:  A 'Turn out area' should be developed and depicted on the radar map.  It could be conditional airspace; used for reversing course when N90 doesn't accept the hand off.  The LOA could be amended to say something like: 'PHL shall have control to take JAIKE traffic all the way to REGAL waypoint. If a hand off cannot be accomplished by REGAL; PHL shall be authorized to enter N90 airspace; in a left turn to a 240 heading (course reversal); at 7000.'6.  When PHL is using non-radar procedures on a major arrival route like the JAIKE3 arrival; a controller's request for modest miles-in-trail should not be denied.  The denial of my request for miles-in-trail will undoubtedly put the north high sector at risk for an operational error or worse.  I requested 20 miles so that we would be able to provide the appropriate non-radar separation to N90 (10 minutes) without having to vector all over our airspace prior to re-establishing the aircraft on the route in order to transition into non-radar.  Because the request was denied; the north high controller must now vector excessively for spacing; in a very small space; while also working PHL departure traffic; and then get the aircraft back on the route; pass the estimates; and terminate radar.  This denial of miles-in-trail leads me to believe that management and TMU do not understand non-radar separation and the workload increase it will cause.",,,,"PHL TRACON Controller described a situation where the receiving sector is using a different radar feed which the PHL Controller is not aware of.

He was issued a 210 heading and 4;000 feet as he was at 3;000 feet on the final.  He went around for another approach and had another TCAS RA with another aircraft in the VNY traffic pattern east of VNY as high as 1;900 feet.  This time BUR tower issued 'Execute the published missed approach' and Aircraft X immediately began a turn south and west back towards VNY VOR instead of waiting to begin the missed approach at the missed approach point.  In the mean time we were on the landline coordinating with BUR tower about the missed approach and had mistakenly said to issue Aircraft X a 210 heading but immediately corrected ourselves to which the tower responded he is already in the turn executing the published missed approach.  Since Aircraft X began his turn early at 3;000 we issued Aircraft Y a turn to 180 immediately who had departed VNY Southeast bound on a 110 heading and was at 3;000 feet within 3 miles of Aircraft X.  We also had Aircraft X turn to a 250 heading and climb to 5;000 to separate the traffic as much as possible.When BUR issues a published missed approach as a controller I expect Aircraft X to keep flying on the approach to the published missed approach point before going around giving time to correct the situation with the other aircraft that will be in the way.  Also as this was Aircraft X second go around there may have been confusion from the pilots point of view as he was issued a 210 heading at 4;000 on the first go around as we did not have any traffic conflicts that would be a problem.  As far as I am aware this was a pilot deviation since they did not execute the publish missed approach properly.",,"Aircraft X was performing an ILS Rwy 8 Approach to BUR (there was a ragged cloud layer with bases around 2;000 AGL and aircraft were getting the field in sight on about a 5-mile final).  While descending on the ILS for BUR; Aircraft X got an RA due to an aircraft in the pattern at VNY.  The pilot climbed and informed LC [local] that he would have to execute a missed approach because he would be too high and too fast to land due to his climb for the RA.LC immediately called TRACON (SCT) to advise them of the go-around.  The TRACON controller tried to get LC to get the aircraft to stay in the pattern; but LC told him that the low cloud cover wouldn't allow the aircraft to do that and we were going to have to execute the published missed approach.  The SCT controller then told her to put the plane on a 210 heading climbing to 4;000; which is the old procedure that we used to have and we're not allowed to do anymore. We have been instructed that due to our lack of a DVA; for an aircraft on an IFR missed approach we may only tell the aircraft to execute the published missed approach; which is for the aircraft to turn 180 degrees and start climbing; which will obviously place the aircraft on a collision course with anyone behind it.  For an aircraft on a visual approach; we must tell the aircraft to remain in the pattern and re-sequence it ourselves; no matter how far we have to take it outside of our airspace to do so (VNY is five miles west of BUR and WHP is five miles northwest of BUR.  Both are busy Class D airports and keeping a jet in the pattern after a go-around at BUR often results in violating the airspace of one of these airports and losing any positive separation with aircraft in the Class D airspace).I have been filing reports for the past year about how unsafe the missed approach situation is at BUR.  The standard when we have a go-around is for LC to call SCT and find a 'Work-around' since the only thing we're allowed to assign (the published missed) results in the aircraft being placed in direct conflict with any aircraft behind it.  The old procedure was to give the missed approach aircraft the SID heading and altitude (heading 210 and 4;000) to turn the aircraft into a 'Departure' to be shipped back to TRACON and sequenced.  This is what SCT usually asks us to do on a missed approach; but we're not allowed to do it.  In this case; the SCT controller asked for the aircraft on a 210 heading and climbing to 4;000 and the controller at LC issued it.  The plane was shipped back to SCT and sequenced.When Aircraft X came back from approach for his second attempt at landing; he got an RA over VNY again and had to go around again.  This time LC didn't have time to call SCT and try to find a 'Work-around;' and issued the aircraft the published missed approach procedure; which is what we've been instructed we must do.  Aircraft X commenced with the published missed approach procedure and immediately lost separation with Aircraft Y; an IFR who was off VNY.  At their closest; the aircraft were at 1.3 miles and around 500 feet of separation; but there was never a time when any form of positive separation existed between the two.I have been reporting this situation for over a year.  In all my years controlling I have never seen a situation as unsafe as the current missed approach procedure at BUR. We have been told that we must place planes in an unsafe situation; as the only thing we can do on a go-around is issue the published missed approach; which causes the plane to turn 180 degrees and start climbing; which will put him into the face of anyone on approach behind him or anyone on a SID off VNY.  We have been told that the solution is to ship the aircraft to SCT as soon as possible so that they can fix the problem. That is ridiculous.  I have never; ever heard of anywhere that has a procedure that equates to 'Point two planes at each other; allow an unsafe situation to develop; and then let someone else take care of it.' The old procedure was for us to give the missed approach plane the SID heading and altitude.  That was taken away about a year and a half ago because it was determined to be illegal since we don't have a DVA at BUR.  We have been told that getting us a DVA [Diverse Vector Areas] is a 'High priority;' but it's been over a year and a half now. If getting us a DVA is what it will take so that we can actually control aircraft and keep them from losing separation; then get us a DVA and get it to us now.  As of now; we don't have the tools we need to keep the airplanes apart at BUR.  This will not be the last time there is a loss of separation due to this situation.",,"SCT Controller describes a situation where an aircraft is issued the published missed approach and starts the turn early causing a conflict with another aircraft along with an airspace violation.",

As the pilot flying I set the altitude in the FCU to 6000 feet and confirmed the altitude as the bottom of the IVANE5 with my First Officer. We initiated a managed descent just prior to TOD. During our descent; in order to maintain profile I extended 1/2 speed brakes when 'More Drag' was displayed. The MCDU displayed 'Too Steep Path' between the following three fixes on the arrival (which to me made no sense). My awareness was up with the anticipation of intervening later in the arrival yet every indication was that the FMS would comply with magenta starts next to each fix. We were to cross MAYOS between 240 and 260. The aircraft appeared to be on a proper profile with the only magenta altitude constraint being displayed as 6000 (the bottom of the arrival) indicating to me that the aircraft would comply without issue with all prior constraints. Nearing the MAYOS fix I allowed myself to get distracted coordinating passenger service issues [while the] aircraft descended below the floor of FL240 at MAYOS and we crossed the fix about 1300 feet low. My First Officer appropriately questioned the altitude and I immediately stopped the descent leveling at FL224; thus the aircraft did not appear as if it was going to respect the following constraint of KIYEN at or above FL220. I manually complied with KIYEN at or above FL220 and during that period noticed that the aircraft programmed path indicated we were over 1500 feet high as we approached the constraint at KIYEN at the proscribed altitude. I manually crossed all of the following constraints to insure compliance prior to being cleared direct to ATELL with a descent to 6000 to join the LOC23. The remainder of the flight was uneventful ending with a normal landing in CLT.  There was no mention whatsoever of the deviation by ATC.Aside from the obvious reason of allowing myself to get distracted nearing a crossing restriction; I do not know or understand why the system behaved the way it did and completely disregarded programmed crossing restrictions and windows; all the while indicating compliance. Even as we approached the MAYOS intersection below the proper altitude the aircraft indicated compliance with magent on the PFD; constraints properly depicted on the ND; and magenta asterisks in the MCDU. As I intervened by leveling off and manually complying with the following altitude constraint at KIYEN the path indicated high leading me to believe that without intervention and with the MCDU properly programmed the aircraft would have continued to descend disregarding this constraint also.Please check the navigation data programming for this arrival specifically on this tail number. I will work on avoiding distraction in the future.",,"We were flying an A321 on the IVANE5 arrival into KCLT. I was the First Officer; the Captain was the pilot flying. We had both accomplished independent verifications of the airspeeds and altitudes associated with the IVANE5 landing South. We were cleared to 'descend via the IVANE5'.  We selected 6000 in the altitude window; the Captain selected Managed Descent at some point prior to the TOD and we had started downhill - everything looked fine. All speeds and altitudes were displayed in magenta. The 'More Drag' and 'too steep path' messages had displayed for waypoints later in the arrival so the Captain had applied Speed Brake. I believe the Captain was 'saying goodbye' to the passengers; and I was momentarily reviewing the Ramp frequencies at Charlotte in my iPad when I looked up as we approached MAYOS (FL240-FL260; 280 kts) and saw that we were passing through 22;900'. All indicators were still magenta; and the magenta 'donut' was centered. My first reaction was to state; 'What's up with our altitude?' The Captain immediately leveled the aircraft off using the V/S knob and retracted the speed brake. We were still 3 or 4 miles short of MAYOS. Everything was magenta. Air Traffic Control did not say a thing.We were distracted and failed to properly monitor. We should have accomplished the actions that distracted us earlier in the flight so that we could be free to monitor and intervene during the arrival.My take away is that I should avoid distraction; especially during these programmed descents and do a better job 'monitoring' our flight parameters. My first reaction should be to 'fix' the aircraft flight parameters (like the Captain did) instead of my first reaction being to question what the aircraft was doing. I should have 'intervened'.

First Officer (FO) Pilot Flying (PF). Approach control wanted us to ID traffic ahead on 12R approach. We could not see traffic. We did ID airport and were given clearance to 3;000 Ft. Sometime after that the traffic became no factor and we were cleared for the approach.  FO turned left toward airport well inside marker. I told him he should come back right so we will be able to intercept final and pick up the glideslope from our altitude; 3;000 Ft. I pointed out that WASHY was the outer marker. He did. I alerted him that now we were going through final and I thought maybe he now sees 12R. I told him to make a left turn back to final and I visually point out 12L. He does not turn; now I am concerned that we will stray into 12R approach.  I felt he lost sight of 12L; I took control of Aircraft and made left turn to final.  He now ID'd runway 12L. I returned control to FO.  I reminded him we were cleared for the approach; he armed the approach and turned off the auto pilot. Auto throttles on.  I thought he wanted to hand fly. We configured on schedule and completed the landing check list. At 1;000 ft. FO stated 'stable speed correcting' Our speed was Vapp +10 and I observed our speed slowing to Vapp. I now diverted my monitoring outside to an aircraft that had taken the runway. I was concerned about spacing for our landing. I queried tower of our landing clearance; which was confirmed. I now saw that A/C begin takeoff role. I am not sure; but about 700 Ft. I noticed speed was Vapp -5  and I announced 'airspeed' there was no reaction. I then saw more then 1/2 dot below glide path and announced 'glideslope'.  I noticed speed decay further with no response on thrust levers; neither auto throttles or FO increased thrust. At the same time FO raised the nose and speed decayed rapidly. I saw the pitch limit indicators come into view rapidly. Suddenly I realized we were in speed on elevator mode; I immediately took control of AC; established a pitch; increased thrust by manually overriding auto thrust. Moments later we were established on speed and glide path; continued visually to landing. This all happened very quickly.   After landing I noticed Altitude set at 700 Ft. on the PFD.  During debrief I asked the FO how did  700 Ft. get set in altitude setting. He stated at one point during approach (hand flying) he was high on glide slope; so he spun in lower altitude - it just happened to stop at 700 Ft.; then selected flight level change. Prior to this we had 3;000 Ft. set; which is glide slope intercept altitude at WASHY and also missed approach alt. I did not know that he had changed the altitude and did not see this happen; maybe I was looking at the check list or looking for traffic. Also; it was not announced. This drove thrust levers to idle and as we got slower we slipped below the glide slope. FO was confused on what was happening and his flight director said lower the pitch to get speed back with elevator at the same time he was proceeding below the glide slope. Also; I asked FO why he chose to turn off the autopilot; he stated his thumb hit the disconnect; so he just continued manually.We do have barriers in place to prevent this from occurring.1. Both pilots should be involved in selecting a new altitude and verified.2. On visual approaches set selected altitude to potential go around altitude; no lower than pattern altitude. 3. Consider highest level of automation on visual approaches at night.4. Pilot monitoring makes GP mode changes during manual flight and high work loads.5. Stabilized approach parameters6. CAMI 7. Communicate all intentions.8.

Not being very familiar with the system; I spent nearly a minute of head-down time looking for the adjustment knob. When I looked up again; we were on the active runway and I advised him to immediately taxi off of it. This occurred at a runway hot spot which is poorly lit and not adequately signed. Our taxi clearance called to taxi via E - A - B - cross runway 23 to runway 30. This was read back; but the student missed the right turn onto B and entered the runway.

Just at lift-off I received a traffic alert but the alert showed traffic was behind me indicating there might be another aircraft on the ground waiting to depart as it was same altitude at rotation. It was just a moment later I received a second traffic alert with a target off to the right a few hundred feet above.The next moment one of my passengers made visual sighting pointing out traffic descending into my altitude converging from my right.  I did not see the traffic at first but my passenger was persistent and continued to point out traffic until I saw it. I then heard on the radio a traffic report from a Cessna Caravan; stating they were on a 'high' downwind entry to Visalia runway 30. I then called on CTAF reporting my position of just upwind runway 30 Visalia. This traffic conflict was about two miles downrange from the airport between altitudes; I believe; 1;300 Ft.

Believing the traffic did not see me and was not responding to my call; I made an immediate climbing left turn; evasive maneuver; leaving my conflicting altitude with traffic to a safer position.  Due to the wing high configuration of my aircraft; I did not see the Cessna Caravan traffic pass underneath.  Looking back towards Visalia out of my left side window; I could see the Cessna Caravan making a left downwind entry to Runway 30 after crossing the centerline of the runway. I made a second radio call after the Caravan passed underneath with the Caravan pilot saying; 'sorry about that'.I immediately called Fresno Approach on the Visalia discrete frequency asking if they; Fresno TRACON; had been working the Cessna Caravan.  The controller stated yes.  I explained the near mid-air collision to that controller.  The Fresno controller said he was working the Cessna Caravan up to but released that aircraft at Kingsburg; Kingsburg is 14 NM and a bearing of 313 from Visalia Airport. The angle between Kingsburg direct to Visalia and our angle from Visalia direct would have put us on a 015 converging course.

A developmental controller was working the tower position. Our instructions were to report 3 miles SSE and to expect Runway 23. I had previously been hearing both the tower dev and instructor issue traffic information to other pilots about a B737 that was inbound on a visual approach to Runway 28; but this information had not yet been issued to me.A Cirrus was in the left traffic pattern for Runway 23 at the time. I was able to gather this from radio chatter while inbound to the airport. The B737 was on the visual approach to Runway 28; who checked in with Lafayette ATCT somewhere along its 5-6 mile right base to Runway 28. Despite not having been personally issued the traffic information from the tower; I saw the B737 turn final to Runway 28; and my student and I were basically paralleling that aircraft on its final approach to Runway 28 at a safe distance.Meanwhile the Cirrus had been instructed to pass behind the B737 so that his downwind to Runway 23 extended east of the B737 on final for Runway 28. The Cirrus was firmly established on an extended left downwind to Runway 23 when the tower asked for my position; which was 4 miles SSE. I added that we were 'paralleling the B737.' It was then that the tower instructor issued traffic information about the Cirrus; I was unable to see that traffic. He came back with an instruction to begin an immediate right turn; presumably to avoid it. The Cirrus crew then saw us and reported us in sight.A radar display in Lafayette ATCT would make a huge difference in forecasting these potential conflicts; which are usually sorted out on a last-minute basis because of the non-radar environment in which we operate. We are very lucky to have controllers as sharp as the ones at Lafayette; but the lack of radar creates an inefficiency that has potential safety implications on the operation of the airport.It is also important to note that neither the Cirrus nor my aircraft were ever issued wake turbulence cautionary advisories. If there had been a student pilot or inexperienced pilot at the controls of either my airplane or the Cirrus; there could have been a wake turbulence encounter given that both aircraft had been asked to pass behind the B737.",,,,"PA-28 Instructor pilot describes an airborne conflict during traffic pattern entry at LAF with a Cirrus already in the Runway 23 pattern and a B737 on a visual approach to Runway 28.

About 40 miles from from the field; once handed off to STL Approach we were were informed that STL just put out a new METAR including freezing rain. We had already reported moderate ice to the previous controller and they were aware we were looking for alternative altitudes and solutions. The STL controller immediately gave us the updated METAR and several pireps for the area including moderate ice reports and one severe from the direction we just came from about 15 min behind us. I checked with the controller what the weather at our filed alternate was as well as several other airports in the vicinity. Unfortunately this freezing rain was a rather wide band covering a very large area. Due to these rapidly deteriorating conditions; I asked for a short approach and any assistance they could give us to get down quickly; and informed them we were receiving moderate to severe icing. I decided that the quickest way in was in fact our primary airport. Alton was closer distance wise but when I asked about it; the controller told me that due to the traffic already going in it would be quicker to go to STL; so this is what we did.The aircraft was light ;just the crew on board; no passengers and this helped keep our minimum icing speed and even allowed me to climb back up to a higher altitude in between layers just the freezing rain to help with the icing problem. The controller got us in as quick as they could. We were able to maintain positive control and airspeed without any upsets or control abnormalities all the way down the approach. Once we landed and inspected the exterior; we saw all the indications of severe ice; however only one inch or so had accumulated in the unprotected areas; and none above the wing. However the bottom of the wing had run back ice that had formed up to almost a foot back. Fortunately the top of the wing was clear and I believe the airspeed helped here.Several aircraft behind me our company and others were also scrambling to get out of the wide spread icing condition. This was the worst icing encounter I have ever experienced. Unfortunately there was no real way to avoid this encounter as it was unforecast and by the time it was reported to us; we were already in it; limiting our options.Honestly; I wish our aircraft were equipped with TKS anti-ice systems instead of boots. This would have seriously reduced the risk of the freezing rain encounter in my opinion; as more of the surface areas are protected. Too bad you can't make an Airworthiness Directive that requires operators to convert to that system.",,,,"C208 Captain reports encountering unforecast freezing rain approaching his destination; with similar conditions throughout a widespread area.

Naturally I began looking for the traffic.A few minutes after that; I was on base turning final; when all of a sudden I saw a Warrior ahead of us on a diagonal final to Runway 18. We were lined up perfectly with the runway centerline; but this pilot had come straight in from the east-southeast. I asked the other instructor if that was him on final; and he replied 'No; that's somebody else.' Sure enough; it was the difficult-to-understand pilot barreling down final.I announced on CTAF and executed a right 360 on final to provide us with additional room behind the aircraft that had just cut us off. The other instructor announced he'd extend his downwind for us. On a subsequent position announcement; I was able to make out the offending aircraft's call sign. Since the pilot was actively on the radio; I said 'Aircraft on upwind at White County; you need to pay more attention; as there are two other aircraft in the pattern here besides yourself;' to which there was no response.The pilot made several additional patterns to Runway 18; never making any clear sense on the radio at any point; before departing the pattern for elsewhere.

The facility was short staffed due to one person calling out sick for the evening. Hold over time was issued; but the person on overtime was not CPC (Certified Professional Controller); only ground certified. The ATM (Air Traffic Manager); who is still certified in the tower; was to provide a break for me. Shortly before the incident; I gave the ground controller a break. The ATM then came up to the tower to look over a power outage issue in the cab. During this time the following events transpired. I had all positions combined; Local; Ground; Flight data and CIC. I had 3 aircraft in the pattern doing touch and go's; 7 aircraft taxiing to the active runway for departure with two being IFR and 1 aircraft inbound that was IFR. (The IFR clearance for Aircraft X had been issued by the ground controller that was on a break). The ATM noticed that there was starting to be a buildup of traffic and called the ground controller off from break. The ATM also noticed that an ATIS was needed and so made the recording for me since I was unable to at the time due to workload. Aircraft X called ready for departure from taxiway A2. I instructed Aircraft X to hold short of RWY 28 at A2 for landing traffic; plus there was an aircraft in front of Aircraft X. He read back 'Holding short A2'; but not the runway 28. Then Aircraft Y called ready for departure also from taxiway A2. I instructed Aircraft Y to hold short of runway 28 at A2 for landing traffic; Aircraft Y was number one in sequence. He also read back 'Holding short at A2'; but not the runway 28. Once the landing aircraft was no longer a factor I cleared Aircraft Y for takeoff with a north departure. I then asked Aircraft X their direction of flight; to which the reply was 'North'. Once Aircraft Y turned on course I cleared Aircraft X for takeoff with a north departure approved; assuming the aircraft was VFR. At some point the ground controller had returned to the tower; but we were unable to do a position briefing due to workload. During the takeoff roll for Aircraft X; a position briefing was finally accomplished. Aircraft X then requested headings. Upon hearing the request I realized the aircraft was an IFR departure and contacted the approach facility to advise them of the deviation from procedure. I believe that being off from work for 3 weeks then being made to work all positions combined while staffing is available is bad practice. As noted above the ATM was facility rated. The ATM noticed that there was a buildup of traffic; but instead of assuming the ground position when there was a possibility; another controller was called that was unable to help prior to the incident. After the incident and after the ground controller assumed the position; I requested the ATM take the CIC position to further de-combine during a busy time. The ATM declined; yet remained in the tower for approximately 15 minutes. I was eventually relieved from local position by the ATM after being on for over 2 hours 40 minutes.

The pilot never descended below the MVA and then was vectored to RWY 5.",,"While enroute; we checked the ATIS and the broadcast said that 'ILS Runway 5' was in use. So we prepared for the ILS 5 and briefed the approach. Upon reaching the airport vicinity and being handed off to approach; the Charleston Approach Controller told us that the ILS Runway 23 was now in use; which was basically straight in from our present track. We prepared for the ILS 23 and briefed the approach. We were cleared to join the localizer and cleared for the ILS 23. I could hear a faint Morse code identifier when I identified the localizer. The flight director and autopilot captured the course. Approach told us to contact Charleston Tower. The Tower cleared us to land on Runway 23. The flight director and autopilot then captured the Glideslope. We noticed that the autopilot seemed to start to have problems tracking the flight director. Then both of us noticed that we started to get erratic indications from the flight director and our instruments (which we did not get until that point - up until then; the course needle and glideslope were centered and captured); so we performed the missed approach SOP. We told the Tower we had gone missed and he had us fly the runway heading and contact Charleston Approach again. Charleston Approach then told us that that they had been using Runway 23 earlier in the day and had switched to Runway 5 and that he had forgotten that they were now set up for the ILS 5. He told us that the Localizer and Glideslope for Runway 23 were not turned on and apparently; we were tracking 'false signals' from the ILS 5 Localizer and Glideslope antennas. It appears that the ILS approaches for Runways 5 and 23 use the same Localizer antennas.

We were first given Aircraft Y on departure; who was a very slow climber that was on the LINDZ8 departure. His next Fix was JNC; Grand Junction VOR; which means that we couldn't not turn that aircraft until he was either 13 miles northwest of the field or out of 14;000 feet MSL due to the MVAs in that area. Then local control launched Aircraft X right behind Aircraft Y; who was also on the LINDZ8 departure. Aircraft X outperformed Aircraft Y as it should have. There was also training going on in local control. At ASE we cannot use diverging headings to separate traffic right off departure end. They will be on the same course until one on them reaches the MVAs so that departure control can then turn them. We cannot vector below the MVA at ASE because all of our prominent obstacles are not depicted on the radar map. The OJT Instructor on local control didn't do anything to correct the trainee's mistake and let the whole thing happen. The last out local had was to stop the Aircraft X at 12;000 feet MSL and keep him as slow as possible but Aircraft X still caught up to Aircraft Y before we were able to turn Aircraft Y to a diverging heading. On terminal control; we told Aircraft Y to expedite his climb and gave him traffic. The small aircraft was doing the best he could. We then gave Aircraft Y a turn to 290 to try to separate the two aircraft but it wasn't enough. We couldn't turn that aircraft any further or else he would have flown into the MVA. When Aircraft X had finally reached 12;000 feet MSL (the MVA for a right turn); local control switched him to us and we turned him right immediately. Once the pilot was on course; he came over to us and asked up to relay a message to local control. He said that he would prefer to sit on the ground longer then try to go that slow and remain that low. The local controllers went down stairs after finishing training and looked at the replay of the event. They notified us that it was not a loss; so the CIC did not file Mandatory Occurrence Report on the event. An email was sent to me from the ATM notifying me that he thinks this event in a loss but he wasn't sure if visual separation was being applied. I am not sure if visual separation with local control was being applied. This is a classic situation where you do not want to jam your departure controller. Know your types of aircraft and know that you do not have any outs if you decide to launch two aircraft back to back and the back one will outperform the front one. Also; if you are the OJT Instructor; be smart about how far you are willing to let your trainee take it before it becomes a loss or an unsafe situation.",,"I was training on TC (Terminal Control) position which works both arrivals and departures. LC (Local Control) was also training and; launched Aircraft Y off runway 33 who was a slow climber and flying at a slow rate of speed. Due to the unique control operation at ASE there are no fan headings for departures; and both aircraft were to fly the LINDZ8 SID. LC trainee then launched Aircraft X with Aircraft Y about .5nm off the departure end of runway 33. Aircraft X is known to be higher performance and the LC trainer or CIC did not stop the LC trainee and let Aircraft X continue for departure. Aircraft X immediately began overtaking Aircraft Y and the LC trainee switched Aircraft Y to TC; then issued traffic to Aircraft X and instructed them the maintain 120 and do not exceed 230 kts. When the speed was clearly not going to work LC trainee issued 'Maintain 200 kts or less'.When Aircraft Y checked on I issued the climb to final altitude and my instructor told me to expedite the climb for Aircraft X traffic. A few moments later my instructor told me to turn Aircraft Y to a 290 heading (Aircraft Y was not at a safe altitude to be given a northerly heading due to MVA's) and issue traffic at 6'oClock and I did which resulted in Aircraft Y slightly increasing their climb rate. At this point the LC Instructor had stepped in and taken control of the situation however it was already just about too late. The LC instructor continued to issue traffic calls until the situation was resolved from the LC and then switched Aircraft X to TC. Aircraft X was climbed and turned right direct JNETT to put him on course; and Aircraft Y was sent on course to JNC thus completely resolving the situation. Later Aircraft X did make a minor complaint about how it was not ideal for them to maintain such a low altitude at a restricted speed for as long as they were.More emphasis on same runway separation for departures with a large gap in aircraft performance during training. Be more aware of aircraft performance and not let the student have more room to make an error just because they may be farther along in training.",,"ASE TRACON Controllers report of a loss of separation given to them by ASE Tower.

Upon checking in with NORCAL Approach Control we were informed that there was a new ATIS and we would be flying the LDA PRM RWY 28R. So we initiated the LDA brief passing approximately FL190.The 28R LDA PRM approach requires us to be the following aircraft and visually identify the aircraft on 28L before we can continue past intersection DARNE; 3.4 miles from the end of the runway and a Decision Altitude of 1;140 feet.Approach control had us intercept the LDA for 28R and was clearing us for descent 1;000 feet at a time; roughly the same as the published altitudes but late enough that we were above the glideslope for most of the approach. A lot was happening during this time so some of the altitudes and speeds may be off but it is my best recollection. We were slowed to 160 kts around HEGOT so as not to overtake the twin turboprop on approach to 28L. After WASOP we were cleared to 3;000 feet and cleared for the approach. The autopilot and autothrottle had been engaged since TOD. We reached 3;000 feet before intercepting the glideslope so the aircraft leveled off. The pilot flying disconnected the autopilot and autothrottle and continued the descent in an attempt to catch the glideslope. The Flight Director (FD) bars were in altitude hold so they were directing a pitch up. The pilot flying (PF) apparently did not completely disregard the FD because the airspeed got slow enough for the oral 'Airspeed Slow' Warning to sound. He added power and adjusted pitch to regain our assigned speed. We then configured for landing; slowed to target speed; and descended to the glideslope. During this time there was a discussion as to whether a go around should be executed. We were on speed; course; glideslope; configured for landing before 1;000 feet; and we both felt landing was as safe as going around so we landed.Some contributing factors.A rushed Brief.Early morning pick up; home base time.Approach controller with late descent and approach clearance. Pilot not flying (PNF) late with lower altitude set in the altitude window.Lots of distractions; in and out of IMC; looking for traffic; radio communications and frequency changes.Some thoughts on how this might have been avoided.A more thorough briefing. We were inside of MIUKE so 1;800 feet was the minimum altitude. The PNF did not set 1;800 feet which would have allowed the aircraft to continue descending without leveling off at 3;000 feet. Better monitoring of aircraft performance by both pilots.",,"Prior to descent we prepared and briefed for the MODESTO 5 arrival and the FMS Bridge visual with the possibility of the ILS 28R. On the arrival we were told there was a new ATIS and to expect the ILS PRM 28R approach. We quickly set up and briefed the new approach. We were cleared to the IAF then given a heading then re-cleared to the IAF. We were given numerous step down altitudes and finally cleared for the approach around 3;000 feet. At that point; the approach mode would not capture and we were not descending; probably because we were above the glideslope and did not reset the altitude alerter. I disconnected the autopilot and auto throttle to recapture the glideslope. The fight director was commanding pitch up which may have distracted me from pitching down as I intended. I got too slow and activated the 'airspeed low' aural warning. I corrected with pitch and power. We were soon in VMC and stabilized above 1;000 feet and made a normal landing. I think getting up [early morning] my time may have contributed to my poor performance.",,"B737 flight crew describes mistakes that occurred during an ILS PRM 28R approach into SFO and indicates the following contributing factors: fatigue and ATC stepping the flight down 1;000 feet at a time.",

The database did not allow or show any transitions or vias. I briefed the ILS DME 5R; plate 11-2. This approach tracks outbound from SMO then joins the localizer. The FMS database did not show this track outbound and showed a discontinuity between SMO [and] CI05R. We deleted the discontinuity to connect SMO to CI05R (Incorrectly). We verified the track in the FMS agreed with the Jeppesen Chart. When we passed SLM; Approach Control gave us direct to MAVEK and cleared for the RNAV ILS 05R. I had never heard of an RNAV ILS so I thought it just language/accent issue and continued with the ILS plan we had made. I confirmed with the Captain (CA) that we were cleared for the approach. At this point MAVEK is not programmed in the FMS because we were expecting to go over SMO. The CA said he saw MAVEK on the other Jeppesen Chart for the GPS approach and that SMO [and] MAVEK are the same spot. He programmed direct to MAVEK; which put in a discontinuity; so I then connected it to CI05R. It was still looking good to both of us at this point. We started to slow to 160 KIAS and get configured per the 10-7 pages but ATC requested 200 KIAS until MAVEK which we accepted. Just before MAVEK I reselected 160 KIAS. For an unknown reason; reaching MAVEK; the aircraft reverted to heading mode flying straight ahead on our current heading and did not turn left as we expected. The CA quickly said that it was in heading mode and we need to turn left. At this time ATC also called us and asked if we were going to turn left. We replied yes. I intervened by pressing the heading button to arm the NAV which it captured right away with a hard left turn to re-intercept the course. Before MAVEK we were at 12;000 FT and had set 9;200 FT in the ALT Select for the next step descent at CI05R (Incorrectly). ATC must have seen our sharp turn to re-intercept our course and gave us a vector for the 05R localizer. I think it was around a 160 degree heading to join. We took the heading and continued our descent to 9;200 FT. Reaching 9;200 FT ATC called us and said we were supposed to be at 9;700 FT. We replied and did an open climb back up to 9;700 FT. We received one more vector; about 10 degrees right of the previous heading to join. We joined the localizer and intercepted the glideslope. We were handed off to Tower; cleared to land; and landed without further incident.We knew that MMMX was considered an enhanced threat airport and I prepared by completing a MMMX PowerPoint presentation in Learning on Line. We had also thoroughly reviewed all the Company Charts in the Jeppesen app. The first contributing factor was the fact that although MMMX is shown to have D-ATIS we were unable to retrieve ATIS through our ACARS. All we could receive was TERM WX which was helpful but did not print approaches in use and landing runways. The CA had to listen to the ATIS over the normal frequency and write it down. It was broadcast in Spanish and English. The parts I heard were hard to understand but ILS 05R was clear enough.The next factor was the FMS database and Jeppesen Charts. The only FMS choices are for the ILS05R; VOR05R; or the basic 05R. There is no RNAV/GPS 05R or ILS DME 05R. Additionally; once we selected ILS 05R with the DATU2A; there were no options to select a Transition or Via. With this combination of DATU2A [and] ILS05R it displays a discontinuity between SMO [and] CI05R and omits outer waypoints. Now I know that to display the entire ILS 05R you have to select NO STAR but this is cumbersome because you are flying the STAR up until you get cleared for the approach. As to the Jeppesen Charts; plate 11-1 RNAV (GPS) OR ILS Rwy 05R [and] plate 11-2 ILS DME 05R; are too similar and easily confused. Both plates have the word ILS in them. Also the first plate 11-1; the one we actually should've used; starts with RNAV/GPS so I think we instantly overlooked it and didn't further readthe 'OR ILS 05R' part of it. I would suggest that this plate should split into each of its respective functions instead of a combo plate. I would also suggest that the FMS database be able to accept DATU2A; ILS 05R via MAVEK. Another problem with the DATU2A is that it has you fly to SLM then track SLM R-219 to SMO and expect approach authorization from there (it's even labeled IAF on the STAR Plate). SMO happens to be the IAF for plate 11-2 ILS DME 05R. I feel like it leads you to that approach. 1. Split Jeppesen Chart 11-1 into two separate procedures. 2. Update FMS Database to allow approach vias. Update FMS to include ILS DME 05R. 3. Include info in the MMMX training PowerPoint about putting in NO STAR to activate all fixes. Include a warning not to confuse the ILS 05R with the ILS DME 05R.",,,,"A320 First Officer experiences confusion after Approach Control gave him direct to MAVEK and cleared for the RNAV ILS 05R at MMMX.

The System was otherwise indicating no pressure. We entered the discrepancy in the log book and called maintenance. The maintenance technicians were instructed by Maintenance Control to apply MEL 29-30-03F; ECAM HYD Page Indications; System Pressure.  I was uncomfortable with the validity of this MEL as our Flight manual indicates that system pressure is depicted by the three numerical values at the top of the ECAM page only. I brought this up to the maintenance technicians who were applying the MEL and they said they were doing what Maintenance Control had instructed them to do and assured me that that green line was; indeed; a pressure indication. I objected and asked them to provide some form of documentation to show that this fell under the MEL they were applying. Maintenance Control was not willing to provide any documentation; but the technicians provided some documentation that this was a pressure indication.... Still not comfortable; I tried to call scheduling to get a number to talk to a chief pilot but sat on hold for quite some time. I also tried to look up some reference which would give me an idea of whether this MEL was appropriate. As we no longer have any kind of a Systems book other than the A320 training manual; which is too vague for this purpose; I was unsuccessful in that endeavor. At this point; I had nothing other than a vague recollection from my original systems training in 1996 that this was different from a system pressure; and the people whose job and responsibility it is to determine what is an appropriate MEL all assured me that it was correct. At this point we looked again at the ECAM HYD page and noticed the line had turned amber (normal). At that point; since the problem was clearly documented the fault no longer existed and we couldn't find anything excluding this fault from the MEL; we decided to depart.After we departed; I was still uncomfortable; so I looked again at the MEL for more definitive information. The one thing that I noticed is that for this MEL; it states that there are three installed and one may be inoperative. Because there are three numerical pressure indications at the top of the ECAM page; I feel this casts some doubt on the appropriateness of this MEL for this particular failure.The main reason the event occurred is that the MEL and Flight manuals are not specific enough; in my humble opinion to determine if this is an appropriate MEL for the system failure being addressed. Also; I have been told things by local maintenance in the past that turned out to be not correct. I can't name a case where Maintenance Control was incorrect; but after a few experiences; I don't trust maintenance to tell me what I can and cannot fly with without clear documentation. In order to be more sure of our actions; and not delay flights with maintenance issues; we need someone we can easily and quickly contact during all operating hours; whom we trust; to discuss such issues. This is a complicated airplane and history has shown me that maintenance is not that someone.  When writing an MEL; it must be impossible to think of all the scenarios which may occur like this. That is; cases where it is unclear if an MEL is appropriate. It would be helpful in this case if a note were added to the MEL including or excluding the green line in question. It would also be helpful if the Flight manual labeled this green line. I was unable to find a reference anywhere describing exactly what it is....Please understand; that like most pilots at this airline; I want to operate a safe aircraft and I want to operate on time. I find ambiguity in the operation to be my large impediment to attaining this goal.",,,,"A Captain reports their A320 MEL and Flight Manuals are not specific enough to determine if an MEL 29-30-03F of an ECAM Hydraulics Page Indications; System Pressure is appropriate for the system failure being addressed.

As I was pushing the throttles up to move the jet for taxi and the jet was just starting to move; I noticed the tug that was used for pushback approaching the jet a high rate of speed. My first officer also noticed and I stopped the jet. Apparently the pushback crew was concerned that they had left the access panel open and they were coming back to verify that it was closed. Unfortunately we were in the process of taxiing for takeoff and were not expecting them to approach the jet while we were moving. This could have resulted in a serious accident had we both not been as vigilant as we were. We learned that operations had been trying to contact us so that the ramp crew could come out and verify that the access panel was closed; but due to non-tower operations we had one radio selected to ZZZ and the other radio selected to CTAF so we weren't monitoring company frequency as we normally would. In my opinion this event was caused solely by the ramp crew rushing to push us back so that they could go home. I've recently observed a pattern of unsafe activity by ramp personnel at this station. Last week we were approximately 40 minutes late pushing due to a late inbound airplane. During pushback the ramp crew was absolutely reckless in their pushback and they pushed us back at a very high rate of speed. I asked them to slow down but they continued a fast push and I was afraid they were going to jackknife the pushback tug at the end of they push they turned the jet so quickly with the tug just prior to the termination of the push back. This pattern of behavior is going to result in a serious; if not fatal accident if something is not done to slow these guys down and emphasize safe push backs. This issue was immediately brought to the attention of [station] operations right after it took place and I also notified my supervisor of the unsafe operation as well.",,,,"A B737 Captain reported improper and unsafe ground handling by ramp personnel.",

Conditions at VNY were VFR; but SMO was IFR with a 1000 foot ceiling and limited visibility due to fog and haze. Thus the need for the IFR clearance.According to my notes; I was given the following clearance by VNY clearance delivery:'Cleared to the Santa Monica airport via the ADAMM ONE departure; VNY 095 radial; DARTS; Direct. Climb and maintain 4000; expect 5000 in ten minutes. Comply with the Obstacle Departure Procedure (ODP); except for the altitude restrictions.'After repeating the clearance; I referenced my charts. The relevant portion of the ODP states the following: 'climbing left turn on heading 050 and VNY-095 to DARTS.'  However; the ADAMM ONE procedure states: 'climbing left turn heading 110; then expect radar vectors to VNY-095.'Because the ground controller emphasized that I should follow the ODP; I made the assumption that ATC expected me to follow the directional guidance provided by the ODP; and thus after departure began my left turn; passed through a heading of 110; intending to stop my left turn at 050. Unfortunately; this was apparently not what was expected of me; and as a result; I began to head for the BUR final approach course; which was in use by an air carrier. The Burbank sector controller immediately directed me to turn right to a heading of 180 to avoid a separation error; and I immediately complied.In retrospect; while on the ground at VNY; I should have clarified any confusion I might have had with the conflict between the SID and ODP with the clearance controller. I was about to enter very busy airspace on a day in which flight conditions had repeatedly changed between VFR and IFR. I was stressed; and I could tell that the controllers involved in this incident were stressed as well due to the workload; traffic; and conditions. In this case I should have swallowed my pride and; rather than trying to appear 'professional'; admitted my confusion and asked for clarification on the ground.",,,,"Pilot reports of confusion after receiving his clearance from VNY ATCT.

I started the engines and called for the after start check list. I performed a 'thru flight' flight control check and everything felt normal (no binding or resistance issues) and the control forces seemed normally loaded. A takeoff brief was given and the taxi checklist was performed. Once take off clearance was given; we performed a line up checklist and I lined the aircraft up in position on runway 25. I advanced the throttle thru 1.25 EPR and engaged the auto-throttles; released the brakes and began the takeoff roll. At approximately 70-80 knots; I heard an audible 3 bong warning and saw the red master caution warning light illuminate. I immediately called the abort and pulled the throttles to idle. A light amount of braking pressure was applied. We coasted to the end of the runway and exited [the runway]. My Copilot and I discussed possible causes for the warning and both agreed that we did not see any CASS message to help us determine the probable cause. My Copilot pulled up the exceedance page and we agreed there was no exceedance recorded. I then asked my copilot to check the circuit breakers in the cockpit for any that may have tripped. His cursory inspection did not reveal any tripped circuit breakers. We then discussed what I thought may have been the cause and suggested that perhaps we had an LP exceedance. I believed it was in fact the cause; and we elected to return for another takeoff attempt. I briefed my Copilot that I would set the takeoff power manually. We performed another lineup checklist and were cleared for takeoff. I lined up the airplane on runway 25 and firmly held the brakes while I advanced the throttles to takeoff power; my copilot verified that takeoff power was set and I released the brakes. We accelerated through 70-80 knots when again we had the three bong and master caution warning; I quickly looked at the engine instrument and observed that the LP [engine Low Pressure bleed] had gone into the yellow arc and reduced the power slightly back into the white arc. We continued accelerating through V1 and then at Vr I attempted to rotate the nose up. As I pulled back on the yoke; the flight controls did not respond normally to my input. The controls had no noticeable pressure resistance and felt unloaded with hydraulic pressure. I moved the yoke forward and then back further aft and still had the same result. I immediately told my copilot I had no flight controls and began the abort. I pulled the throttles to idle and applied maximum braking and then initiated full reverse thrust and called for speed brakes. Once aircraft was at a slow speed we advised tower of our rejected takeoff and proceeded to exit runway and brought the plane to a stop on taxiway 'A' facing east and shut down both engines. We had very hot brakes and they should approach with caution. The Incident Commander then came over the radio and advised that there was smoke rising from the right main landing gear. I then asked my copilot to contact FBO and organize a tug to tow us. While we were doing this the Incident Commander stated 'Captain; evacuate the aircraft now; you have a fire on the right landing gear'. The copilot and I both jumped out of the seat and I instructed passengers to evacuate the aircraft now while copilot cleared and opened the main cabin door. Once the passengers and copilot were off the airplane; I exited and advised the responders that the aircraft was clear and everyone was off. The passengers were escorted to a waiting van and were taken back to the FBO. My Copilot and I were both instructed by Incident Commander to sit in his truck while they initiated fire suppression. Once the scene and aircraft were secured the plane was moved to a secure hangar and locked.",,"PIC pulled the throttles to idle and applied maximum braking and then full reverse thrust; I (SIC) deployed speed brakes and went for full flap in an attempt to create more drag to stop the aircraft inside the runway boundaries.

FLY is very near to COS Class C airspace; a notch is cutout so that aircraft arriving and departing do not have to contact Springs Approach. Most aircraft departing the FLY traffic pattern do contact Springs Approach for flight following; pick up clearances; etc. I suspect what happened was the Bonanza switched frequencies immediately upon departure and contacted Springs Approach for a clearance. In doing so he was not on CTAF when I made my announcement of a 45 degree entry to downwind.FLY can be very busy and I believe aircraft arriving or departing; not remaining in the pattern; should be required to contact Springs Approach.

City vehicle called from B10 (south end of RWY 13R) to proceed north on the runway for a routine inspection. I cleared city vehicle to proceed north on RWY 13R. I then returned to a conversation with Flight Data controller referencing an interesting aircraft at an FBO ramp.Sometime later; I estimate 1 minute; Aircraft X called ready for a (west) departure from RWY 13R full length. I did a cursory scan of 13R; as I usually do; then cleared him for takeoff. A few moments later Aircraft X said 'Tower there's a vehicle on the runway!' I scanned and observed Aircraft X in position; but not moving and city vehicle northbound; almost to B3 (approximately 3;000 feet from Aircraft X). I immediately instructed city vehicle to exit the runway at B3; which he was already rapidly doing. I immediately informed the CIC of the error then re-scanned RWY 13R and again cleared Aircraft X for takeoff. At which point Aircraft X departed without further incident. During this incident Aircraft X had never started a takeoff roll. After the aircraft departed I realized that I had never activated the RID (Runway Incursion Device) for RWY 13R. Our policy clearly states to do so. I don't have any recommendations per say. But I do know that from now on I will always use the RID when I have a vehicle on the runway. Additionally I will use our 'high chair'; which allows scanning the middle portion of the runaway. It is very difficult to do so in the lower; more comfortable chairs that we usually use. During my 1st scan of the runway I was unable to see the middle portion or the runway due to tower cab equipment. This is a hot spot if you sit low.

We laughed and both thought that maybe it's a ZZZ; so it doesn't have ACARS; and we actually both mentioned that it was the first time in a long time that we had an aircraft without ACARS.After that; I continued my duties and got the clearance and ATIS via COMM 2 (the old fashioned way) and we went about as normal. After we got back 3 flights later; we were informed that we were flying an aircraft that should have had an MCDU but did not.The Captain and I had discussed the issue prior to the first flight; and thought that since nothing was in the logbook to indicate that ACARS had been removed; maybe this is the way this ZZZ was configured. Had it been a XXX or YYY; I am sure the level of scrutiny would have been higher.Now that I know this issue of having no ACARS is a non-normal event (even in a ZZZ); I will call Maintenance immediately if this situation should arise again.",,"Both pilots of a B737 were a little surprised to see a Flight Manager Computer (FMC) unit without an Automatic Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) access function.

They subsequently learned the lack was unintentional and should have been entered in the Aircraft Maintenance Log (AML) and investigated.",

I notified the First Officer of the target and he reported it to ATC. Simultaneously we got an aggressive RA to Climb; Climb NOW and ATC gave us a traffic alert climb immediately! I went to TOGA (Take Off/Go-Around) thrust from flight idle and began to follow the RA guidance on the VVI. To my and the first officer's surprise; the thrust took 4 to 5 seconds to go to TOGA!!! Recognizing the delay in thrust response; I started a right turn away from the TCAS target to evade the target laterally. The FO reported to ATC we were in a TCAS climb and called for me to keep climbing and confirmed I had TOGA selected. As thrust finally went to TOGA and with the turn away from the target; we began to aggressively climb and the RA conflict resolved.

As I said earlier; it has been my experience that this check is done when I am absent from the flight deck. So; as a result of the Captain responding to a checklist item that he/she in fact does not complete; one of four things must occur:  1. The Captain must always ask the First Officer if they in fact checked the hydraulic system and ground proximity system; or 2. the Captain must physically conduct the check on their own; or 3.  It must be a requirement for the Captain to be present during the First Officer's check of these two items;  or 4. The Captain will essentially be lying when they respond 'Checked' to each of these items if they were not actually present during the checks.  I strongly believe that most pilots do item number 4 resulting in 'Normalization of Deviance'.During my career; I have never been required to respond to a checklist item that I am not personally responsible for checking or required to witness the checking.  The response for these two items should be from the First Officer not the Captain.  When I addressed my concern to a 737 Captain evaluator in the training center I was rebuffed and told it was no big deal -  'Normalization of Deviance'.The other item on the PREFLIGHT checklist of concern is 'Mode control panel...........Set [C]'.  The Mode control panel is not completely set when the requirement for this checklist to be completed arrives - 'Normalization of Deviance'.  A very important item - The V2 speed - in the IAS/MACH window for the Mode Control Panel.  As a result; I believe we are lying when we respond 'Set' to this checklist item.  To add to potential errors; when I arrive to the flight deck of a new airplane the inbound crew rarely zeroes out the IAS/MACH window.  The result is that often times the Mode control panel may actually appear to be set due to the target approach speed being potentially close to the departing V2 speed.",,,,"A B737 Captain reported the recent preflight checklist response changes contained some system setting and selection responses which were not completed or were inaccurate.

It had been sitting on the maintenance pad and was warm because it was first flight of the day. We started the APU to cool down the cabin; and then they boarded the passengers. The number 2 flight attendant advised me that there was a loud noise throughout the cabin; but especially row 18; 13 and 7. We were still at the gate so I had maintenance come on board and they deplaned the passengers to work on the duct work. There was disconnected ducting through the aircraft and they fixed it with duct tape and some kind of super glue adhesive. They then signed the book off and operations loaded the passengers back up and we departed.We were climbing through FL300 on our way to FL370 when the number 2 flight attendant called up with shortness of breath. She said that she would call back to see if it went away. We leveled off immediately at FL330 as a precaution; and then called the number one flight attendant. She said that she had shortness of breath and that passengers weren't in distress and that there were fumes in the cabin. I advised the flight attendants that we were going to make an emergency descent into Airport ZZZ and that that they needed to apply emergency procedures. Also that we were going to evacuate through the forward cabin door once clear of the runway. We applied the fumes in cabin QRH; put on oxygen masks; and advised ATC that we needed an emergency descent into ZZZ which was right below us; and declared an emergency. We requested CFR; advised ATC of all pertinent information. It was VMC; and we received vectors to ZZZ using runway XYR. We knew it was going to be an overweight landing; and applied procedures for that. We had a 300 feet per min descent over the fence and landed at the 200 feet mark on the runway with a 0 feet per min descent. It was a smooth landing and we exited the runway to the right and parked in front of CFR. I made the PA for an emergency evacuation through the front passenger door. We also opened the front service door for air ventilation. I opened the cockpit door to help with the evacuation; and the fumes were noticeable. Passengers were calm; and were given first responder attention then bussed to the terminal and rebooked. One passenger was transported to the hospital for inhalation. The aircraft was then towed 2 hours later with me and the First Officer using oxygen masks and the APU running with packs off to terminal so passengers could get their personal belongings. There was no one in ZZZ with CRJ experience to ride the brakes. We didn't want to inconvenience the passengers more than they were already.",,"Flight departed the gate about 2.5 hours late due to earlier maintenance and aircraft swaps. Flight departed without incident. About 32 minutes into flight dispatch noticed on the flight following system that the flight was diverting to Airport ZZZ. I queried the Captain (CA) via ACARS whether he was diverting to ZZZ. I then ran the flight plan per dispatch procedures by estimating his fuel and position and route to ZZZ and the system reported possible overweight landing at ZZZ. I immediately informed the CA to be aware of possible overweight landing in ZZZ at his current estimated weight. CA sent ACARS telling me to standby. I then prepared the diversion entry for ZZZ and awaited the CA's intentions. Two minutes later he sent ACARS that he was going to ZZZ. I then entered the diversion entry and immediately notified the dispatch manager on duty and then called ZZZ operations to inform them of the diversion. Five minutes after the captain informed dispatch of his intentions; the flight landed in ZZZ. With the very limited time available; I failed to amend the dispatch release with the CA to change the destination to ZZZ. This error was rectified in the record history of the flight. There was no disruption to the flight; since the CA used his authority to divert the aircraft to ZZZ without prior and/or expeditious notification to dispatch due to what he considered an emergency for the safety of his passengers and crew.Had the CA provided dispatch with adequate notification of his problem and his intentions; I could have provided his fuel calculations and his amendment to the dispatch release; to include weather; NOTAMS and field conditions for ZZZ prior to his landing at ZZZ. With the limited time I had available; I did the best I could under the circumstances to do what I did for him in 13 minutes from the time I discovered the diversion until he actually landed in ZZZ. The limited communication with the cockpit crew led me to believe that his emergency was such that too much information at that time could have distracted the crew from their task at hand. Fly and land the airplane safely due to the [situation]. Also; the post flight debriefing and coordination with management and the diversion station (ZZZ operations) I failed to enter the amend release entry into the record history of the flight until 2 days later. My error.The company needs to have some kind of improved system for the cockpit crew to notify dispatch of a catastrophic emergency that requires immediate diversion to an enroute airport that is or is not on the original dispatch release. Better communication or more effective ACARS functions allowing the pilot to contact dispatch and quickly relay his intentions could possibly preclude this from happening again. Again; thirteen minutes from discovery [of the issue] to landing; without communication from the cockpit crew; is not time enough for even a highly experienced dispatcher to do all of the coordination and computer entries required in such a [situation].",,"A CRJ700 flight crew and the Dispatcher involved describe a diversion due to fumes in the cabin.

Our planned arrival fuel was 7;000 lbs. An alternate was neither required by regulations nor filed. The Captain coordinated with dispatch to add another 2;000 lbs. of fuel.During cruise; we monitored the destination ATIS. It alternated between VFR/no precipitation; and IMC/TSRA. We were filed and cleared for the AYBID transition of the FRWAY5 arrival. Due to weather; Jacksonville Center re-cleared us direct HURDE; which was on the OMN transition of the FRWAY5 arrival. We advised dispatch. As we approached HURDE; there was a large area of moderate/heavy precipitation west of the arrival; broken areas of moderate precipitation southeast of us; and scattered areas of light/moderate precipitation with some turbulence markers in front of us along the arrival. There was a thunderstorm over PBI; with other scattered areas of thunderstorms moving toward it as well. Our plan was to pick our way through the weather; then hold until the storm over PBI moved; or divert to FLL. FLL was VFR and no weather was south of PBI.In rapid succession; the following happened:-ATC advised us of another airline flight reporting severe turbulence while attempting to arrive at PBI. We instructed the flight attendants to take their seats.-ATC advised us of hail in a large cell 20 nm SW of HURDE; which was moving toward HURDE due to wind.-Another airline flight in the area reported moderate turbulence and turned around.-Another airline flight on the arrival started asking for large deviations around weather.We asked for a 30 degree left turn to avoid a cell in front of us. As soon as we turned; we encountered continuous moderate turbulence; moderate rain; and St. Elmo's fire. We had not yet even entered any of the precipitation painting on our radar. The gaps in the weather in front of us were closing up; and we were surrounded by weather on both the left and right sides. We asked for and were cleared for a left 180 degree turn to the north. I advised dispatch that we had to turn around and may need to divert. We were offshore; and weather extended up the east coast of Florida (off our left now) all the way up to just south of Daytona. No matter what we did next; we would need to go up to abeam Daytona before turning west. We discussed that we could possibly go north to abeam Daytona; west to the west coast of Florida; south around the weather; then east into PBI. The problem was that this would leave us with little extra fuel to hold or divert to FLL if the thunderstorm over PBI had not moved off.We discussed the situation and the captain decided we were diverting to MCO. I advised dispatch. I then saw that in response to my previous message; dispatch sent us several messages instructing us to work our way west through the weather. The worst weather was west of our position; and again; there was no way to go west until we went back north to abeam Daytona. I then was very busy reprogramming the FMC; and talking to ATC; the flight attendants; passengers; and MCO ops. The captain was very busy working our way around weather to join the arrival into MCO.I was not able to coordinate with PBI ops because they do not answer the radio. On a flight on the previous day; on this flight prior to our diversion; and later on this day on a subsequent flight; PBI ops did not answer the radio on the ground or in flight. I later confirmed with PBI ops in person that the frequency on our airport data page is correct and they claim the radio does work.When we were set up for the diversion; I had time to look at received messages from dispatch again. I saw there were numerous messages asking us to again pick our way through the weather west (incorrectly claiming it was clear that way); to divert to FLL if a diversion was necessary; and then to confirm our intentions (I had already clearly stated that we were diverting to MCO). This added to our stress because of previous management inquiry into and threat of discipline toward other pilots who have made decisions to divert contrary to company guidance.I messaged dispatch one last time; stating we were not able to comply with their request due to weather; that we were diverting to MCO; and that we would call them when we were on the ground. We were approaching 10;000 feet. We decided that the numerous; excessive messages from dispatch were becoming a serious distraction; and that we had to wait to communicate with them further until after we parked.We diverted to MCO without further difficulty and landed with; I believe; about 10;000 lbs of fuel. After parking; we checked the PBI ATIS and radar imagery. We saw there was still a storm over PBI and weather in between us and PBI. We believed we could possibly have overflown MCO arrived in the PBI area with 6;000-7;000 lbs of fuel; and then gotten into a bad situation with no further extra fuel to hold and minimal fuel to divert to FLL. This was exactly the scenario we were concerned about; and this confirmed our decision to divert to MCO.I saw there were several more messages from dispatch similar to the previous ones; and then finally a message with an amendment for our diversion to MCO based on 'the captain using authority.' The captain then called our dispatcher while I did the walk-around. The captain described the dispatcher's response to the captain's attempt to explain our concerns and decision-making. He described the dispatcher's response as rude and dismissive.We coordinated with dispatch and MCO ops regarding weather; passenger concerns; use of the tarmac delay snack kit; etc. After refueling and a brief delay for maintenance; we continued to PBI. All of the precipitation had moved off to the east by the time we departed MCO. Dispatch sent us several messages about the weather moving away during our flight to PBI. We completed the rest of our trip without further incident within our normal FDP.PBI Ops must answer the radio. Dispatch should have seen the massive area of weather moving across our arrival and the scattered area of storms over PBI and originally planned for us to arrive with more than 7;000 lbs of fuel. Dispatch could have filed us for the WLACE2 arrival into PBI to come in around the back side of the storms; which were moving east. We could have asked to be re-filed for the WLACE2 arrival. Dispatch could have kept us updated about the weather while we were enroute. We could have asked for updates about the weather while enroute. However; based on past experience; it is hit-or-miss whether dispatch will respond to such requests. Dispatch provided us no information prior to our message stating we had to turn around for weather. A proactive suggestion to request a re-route would have improved our situation. Instead; dispatch later provided us a distracting overload of information in an attempt to avoid a diversion. They attempted to convince us to follow a plan that would have burned all of our extra fuel and put us in a position with no remaining good options. The company culture causing this reversal of priorities needs to be improved.",,,,"Air Carrier First Officer reports diverting to an alternate airport due to thunderstorms over and in the vicinity of their destination airport; against the wishes of their Dispatcher.",

The captain flying ANSUG 1A RNAV arrival with the ILS T 9L.  A series of directs and changes in altitude added to the confusions and task saturation.  Cleared for the approach at MARPU; speed was 190/7000 flaps 5 and cleared to descend to 5500 feet.  ATC: 'What is your heading?' AC: '150[KIAS]' ATC: 'Maintain 150.'   Confusion in the cockpit all crew members are wondering if we are still cleared for the approach or are we going through the LOC.  AC: 'Are we cleared for the approach?'  ATC: pause 'Yes maintain 150 cleared for the approach descend to 4;200 feet.' We turned at UTKET. We set 4;200 feet; Captain select FLCH; sets min bug for 15 flaps; pulls speed break handle; and calls for flaps 15.  FB: 'Way high you need gear.' Captain disconnects Autopilot.

We landed 1500 feet down the runway--a normal touch down.Understanding directions and deciphering clearances from South American controllers is difficult during the day hours.  Fatigue may have been a factor due to a departure delay.  ATC direct clearances; constant changes in altitudes and heading are distracting.  Compounded with an approach that does not join well from an RNAV arrival to ILS.   Definitely a factor.",,"Departed approximately 1:20 late. Captain's leg. Upon arrival into GRU we were given final approach altitude on downwind on arrival and clearance to complete approach. On dogleg to final approach control asks what is our heading. The Pilot Not Flying (PNF) responds '120'. Approach then states 'maintain heading.' This was a confusing instruction by the controller. I asked what does that mean and the Captain asked as well. The First Officer (FO) confirmed with the controller if he wanted us to intercept and complete the approach. The controller stated yes; intercept and cleared approach very emphatically. This confusion caused us to be late turning and slightly high. The captain slowed and configured. I; as the relief pilot; stated 'we are high we need the gear' The gear was lowered and we descended. Upon interception of GS the captain had speed brakes out with full flaps and received a Master Caution alert. The airplane became slow and both the FO and me shouted 'airspeed' at the same time. The captain applied power and then continued the approach. The approach speed kept increasing and he kept using speed brakes which caused the decent rate to be uncomfortable. At approx. 500 feet the FO stated 'GO AROUND'. I remember seeing all red on the VASIs and seeing the runway at an angle that was too low from where I was seated in the jump-seat. I was about to command a go-around as well and the FO beat me to the punch and called again for go around and moved his hand in a forward motion as to emphasize the urgency of the situation and the captain increased power (I believe throttles were at idle). The engines spooled up and we popped up a bit in altitude. I thought he was going around but he then stated 'no; I have it' and he landed the airplane. Landing and rollout were un-eventful.ATC instructions were confusing but go around should have been done in my opinion. Weather was not a factor however as much as we are used to all night flying; fatigue is always a factor. I should note that before the flight left ZZZ; the captain stated that this was a long flight in the middle of the night and if anyone sees something that is not right please chime in and even call a go around if needed.",,"Multiple factors combined to result in a seriously un-stabilized approach during which multiple calls for a go-around by the two first officers went without response.

The Load Verification Manifest is no longer available as the auto WB system is paperless; but I had been told that cans are only allowed to be in the positions set forth by the ramp agent who builds the load sheet. This is the person who was notified by Dispatch and told about the voids. There was some confusion on my part as to how the new paperless system should not allow a voided position to be filled. Turns out the auto WB system does not 'Know' about MELs at this time. Once airborne; we received a message from Dispatch notifying us of a possible position transposition and after we landed it turned out that the cans were put in the wrong place.It appears the ramp agent transposed the positions that were voided. The Auto verify system is not currently capable of catching those errors. A Load Verification Manifest is no longer available to the crews as the Auto WB is paperless. I understood that the load crew was aware of the MEL and expected the Auto WB to protect the voids.1. Have the ramp agent present the Auto WB device so the crew can verify the voids. (Short term) 2. Have the Auto WB system be able to pull MEL's and protect against these kinds of errors. 3. Have the release system add another tab showing the load plan so crews can verify the MEL voids on the computer before signing the release. This way; the crew can see the plan before stepping. 4.

I went to the cockpit and found 16 quarts indicated on the EICAS engine display; the right engine showed 21 quarts (normal quantity). The co-pilot was outside the cockpit; so I stepped out to ask him if he had noticed the left engine oil quantity. He was vague in his recollection but did remember seeing the 16 quart indication. Neither crew member had written it up which I thought rather strange since it was below ETOPS limits for the return flight. I researched the logbook for oil consumption and found a consistently high amount of oil being added for at least the prior 5 days. We serviced the left engine with 4 more quarts in Airport ZZZ after a 5 hour flight from Airport ZZZ1 again. The engine was consistently leaking large quantities of oil but no one caught it or stopped the plane from flying ETOPS. It was leaking from the IDG drive shaft drain because the O-ring on the drive shaft was cut and almost 1-4 of the circumference was missing half its diameter I do not understand how so many pilots or mechanics did not recognize the high consumption rate or see the leak under the engine. The Oil Monitoring Program did not flag the consumption because it is triggering point of 8 quarts added at any given time was not exceeded.

I was the nonflying pilot doing [operational experience] training for a captain new to the company with excellent previous experience in jets and turboprops. There had been earlier reports of light snow and freezing rain; but the weather had improved one hour before our arrival to VFR. Several aircraft had made landings at the airport so we felt confident on the safety of the mission. Landing was uneventful except for a loss of seven knots on short final which we reported to the tower along with braking action good on the runway. We landed runway 16 and used all of the runway exiting to the left at the end on taxiway Lima as instructed by ATC to taxi for the FBO. Snow and ice removal and runway/ taxiway treatments were in effect. We taxied off runway 16 onto Lima and proceeded northbound. We were taxiing at a speed of 4 knots aware of surface conditions. There was a quartering strong tailwind from our rear left. Taxiway Lima slopes down and 1500 feet into our taxi; about 1000 feet from taxiway Charlie the steering horn went off; advising us of steering problems; I called out 'stop the aircraft'. [The pilot in training] responded 'I'm trying!' At this point the airplane was in a slow skid; we were on what turned out to be black ice or clear ice. [The training pilot] had full brakes and manual steering engaged with no results. He also applied thrust reversers. We were in a slow motion sliding; twisting left turn probably caused by the winds on our tail. The airplane exited the taxiway to the left; did not impact any lights and came to a rest with the main wheels on the taxiway and the nose on the grass pointing directly south. We basically skidded and did a 180 degree turn during the skid on the taxiway. We later came to find that [the airport] treats the runways with potassium and chemicals; but that environmental rules prevent them from treating the taxiways. Taxiways are treated with sand only. The area where we slid was basically an inch deep area of water that had frozen into black ice. The speed of the event was very slow and the aircraft stopped on its own once the nose wheel was on the grass. The aircraft was towed off the grass; maintenance inspections revealed no damage and it was put back into service later that night.I recommend the airport review its policies of not treating taxiways with chemicals as the uneven terrain [provides] many places where black ice can form and; this being a 121 airport; seems contradictory to safety.",,,,"After landing safely at their destination; the flight crew of an LJ-60 found the taxiways covered in black ice and were unable to prevent the jet from sliding off the taxiway.

BOS was landing Runway (RY) 4R; and I was using the 'Descend Via' clearance; which had been in effect for a couple of weeks; but which I had not been accustomed to using under these circumstances. Near the tail end of a string of arrivals; which had required extensive vectoring and laddering (step-descent); a B737 had flown a little too far to the east for me to feel comfortable giving him a left turn back to PROVI to rejoin the ROBUC1 STAR (about 100 degrees). I decided to send them to the next fix; JOODY; to soften the turn somewhat; and gave the same to the next aircraft; as well. (The next group of planes would be able to proceed over PROVI.)Since there is no mandatory altitude over JOODY; the B737 was able to descend to 9;000 at SOFEE; the next fix. Because the B737 was not over PROVI; he was also not flying through a delegated 'triangle' of airspace given to Boston Approach by Providence Approach when BOS is landing RY 4R. The B737 descended into PVD ATCT's airspace. I had already changed him to Boston Approach. I stopped the following aircraft at 12000 when I realized that something had not gone as I expected.Even after 33 years in the FAA; I guess my experience was not enough to overcome my lack of experience in applying the new 'Descend Via' procedure. The procedure works fine when there are no delays; and when compression is not a factor. When vectoring off-course and rejoining the STAR; the added phraseology can become cumbersome and unwieldy (especially considering its newness).

Instead of getting the continuous horn for 30 seconds immediately; we receive the normal door entry response of 2 distinct momentary horns followed 20 seconds later by the normal entry signal of 2 tone again and then after an additional 20 seconds by the continuous 30 second horn.  The electronic lock worked normally and the emergency entry unlock did unlock the door eventually.   We were released with MEL 52-17.  This required us to deactivate the electronic locking function of the door and removed the ability for emergency access to the flight deck should the need arise.   This MEL 52-17 leaves the door unlocked electrically during the entire flight and requires a manual locking of the door.  Although this is allowed; it involves an addition step that is needed to be performed in a timely manner should the flight deck be rushed during an attempted breach.   Each flight attendant was instructed and actually performed these steps prior to our departure with the emphasis of the door being unlocked until turning the manual lock.   Upon further review; MEL 52-17-XX would have been the better deferral available for this defect of the key pad system.   It would have allowed us to have the electronic lock available to us the entire flight and the ability for emergency access from the cabin should the need arise.  A defect report was submitted during flight that a different MEL was more appropriate.  It was released with MEL 52-17-XX for subsequent flights.  I am very familiar with the Boeing flight deck door.  I have flown exclusively with this door system ever since we started using them.   In all my years; I have witnessed only one time it hasn't passed a check during preflight.  I almost never use this door since coming back to the 737 fleet 8 months ago.  This is disturbing since this is the 2nd time that I have seen this identical failure.  I am not even sure whether I have flown another aircraft (AC) with the Boeing door system since the last time I experienced this failure (a good month in between these flights).  This might be an issue requiring maintenance to do a system wide check of our Boeing doors.  Both times; I was released with the less desirable MEL 52-17.   Hopefully Maintenance Control will issue the MEL which provides the most safety features of the door in the future; ie MEL 52-17-XX. This malfunction presented itself exactly the same both times.  I cannot emphasis enough that this is an extremely high percentage of failures that I have personally witnessed.   I am not sure whether this is a programing; software; or faulty keypad issues.  This might be an extremely unlikely coincidence; but it could be a 737 system wide problem.  This needs to be addressed immediately by ensuring that all 737 crews performing this door test know the correct audio response.  Since this is a newer procedure for some crews; this defect may not be recognized.  Additionally some type of training might be needed for pilots and flight attendants to ensure proper Boeing door procedures.  We rarely get this door and it is a first flight only test.  There is a potential of this test not being performed.  I caught both of these defects while demonstrating the procedures and functions of the Boeing door to the Flight Attendant (FAs); although a test wasn't required.   I believe a test should be performed every time reporting to the AC.         Although this was not an issue on this flight.  The 737 fleet Boeing door procedures have crews turning on the Flight deck access switch during the flight deck security check and never turning it off when leaving the flight deck.  This differs significantly from previous Boeing door procedures that turn off and open the guard switch on the flight deck access switch when the flight deck is unoccupied on the ground and then to turn it on and engage the guard  cover when thecabin is reported ready prior to pushback.   I believe the 737 fleet should adopt these procedures to prevent being locked out of the flight deck on the ground and to reinforce the requirement to arm and ensure the 'Lock Fail' light extinguishes and the door is locked prior to pushback.  A very important step is being missed by not turning off the access switch after the test; once 'deny' has been selected the door is locked without anyway of entering the flight deck for 30 minutes.  This could cause not only embarrassment on the ground but safety issues as well.",,,,"B737 Captain reports that during preflight; the emergency access test of the flight deck Boeing door provided the wrong audio response.

I was up for ten hours prior to flying an all-nighter.  I was able to catch a nap for 3 hours (two hours during daytime proceeding trip). So I was awake for ten hours prior to an all-nighter cross country flight arriving at dawn.  By the time we got to hotel and ready to lay my head down for sleep it was 7:30.  These hotels; no matter how well they do it; leak sunlight through the curtains.  You have to place something over your head to get true darkness in your room.  It is unnatural at best.  Still; I was pretty tired; so I set my alarm to get 8 hrs. I woke up 5hrs later 12:15ish.  My eyes always feel the same; gritty and dry.  I wouldn't call it a headache; but any pilot that flies these pairings would liken the feeling their head has as a slight tightness or headache?!  It reminds me most of international flying where; in order to maintain some semblance of a way to get rest; crews will take a short nap and then get up in (i.e. London; Paris) and trudge through the day so that they can get to sleep later before flying back to the USA.  The difference is they have a 24hr plus layover to coordinate with their body to get that needed rest.  Even still; international pilots will admit this can be tricky and hard at times willing your body to sleep.So to get back in the groove I work out; and eat; and try to take another short :45 to 1hr nap before flying again in the evening.  I have never flown this next leg (the day after the all-nighter with only 12-14 hr layover) where the pilots do not talk about how little sleep or rest they've gotten the night before.  Are we safe?  Are we able to do the job?  This is the conundrum I will continue to bring up.  While I believe we are able to accomplish the mission; I'm am not sure any NTSB BOARD would determine the pilots; after an incident; were 100% in their findings.  Fatigue studies usually use an analogy that the effects of fatigue are similar in nature to alcohol usage and diminished capability in performing a job.  Clear thought process 'may' be affected in these cases.  One might ask the question; if I had 'one' glass of wine or beer at home; am I okay to drive my car?  People go to restaurants every day and have alcohol with their meals and drive cars; but what are the effects on each individual person.  It is an individual choice!Should pilots be put in this position making these decisions in short time constrained periods?  I contend that the answer after an all-night flight is a minimum of 24 hrs off to recover fully from the effects of this circadian shift.  I have had these kinds of pairings and it makes all the difference.  In a 24 hr period the body can adjust and most certainly will create a second sleep period which corrects the circadian rhythm.  This would be in line with the 24hrs off between international flights.  Makes sense; and is logical. I believe pilots are being forced into this decision based on mostly financial and disciplinary action.  The process of calling in fatigued includes the Flight Office making a determination of whether the pilot will be paid or not - this should give the FAA pause; but in the case of my company - that was a piece the company demanded in defining how a fatigue call would be handled.  This is a created red herring that puts a subliminal message in the pilots head to 'fly' or face the music.  Nothing worse than holding money over someone's head. This concept is clever at best; and as I've stated before 'pilots' are mission oriented by nature.  They will get the job done.  In military operations pilots fly to the edge of these body rhythms; so they know their limit -- but is it safe?  Do we liken military operations to commercial carriage of passengers?  Taking chances or pushing limits is just a way of life in military flying; but again are we transferring this concept to commercial aviation?  I should think not!A pilot going from normal day living to an All-Nighter on the first leg of a pairing is immediately entering the Chronic/Circadian disruption phase after completing that first All-Nighter.  While they are fine to fly that first flight; the recovery the next day is problematic.This is only one slide of the training; and the audio goes into much more detail.  Our own training supports what I am talking about; but that little caveat of retribution on pay lingers out there in the pilots decision tree. (Not mentioned of course in the training)I can see the accident report with the pilot stating 'he has bills to pay.' Not a good ending to an accident that could have been prevented.  I write this because the discussion is not being had; and everyone is just happy to go along with the program.  I can only state that any pilot doing an all-nighter and the very next night flying again saying they are fully refreshed and 100% are not being truthful.  Even when I've gotten 8hrs+ sleep on these types of trips; I still do not feel 100%.  It is unnatural to go from a 'day' schedule in normal day to day living; right into an all-night flight.I strongly suggest the FAA look into; interview pilots independently; or survey (unidentified) to hone in on a best practices concerning the increased amount of all-night pairing creation by commercial airlines.  The simple answer is clearly 24 hrs OFF AFTER ANY ALL NIGHT FLYING ASSIGNMENT.  The effects on the body are almost a carbon copy of international flying effects on the body.",,,,"B737 Captain describes the fatigue he feels after flying an all-night flight and believes that 24 hours of rest should be required after such flights.",

The forecast called for freezing rain and falling temperatures in the early morning. The forecast was accurate.  When the captain and I were walking to the gate; I noticed from the walkway; between terminals; the airplane had type IV de-ice fluid on the wings.  I mentioned this to the captain but I don't think he heard me. When we reach the gate; the captain said he would do the outside preflight and I thanked him.  I checked the top of the wings; from the emergency row exit; and was unable to see the right wing due to the ice that covered the windows on the right side of the airplane.  I then checked the left wing and noticed type IV de-ice was sprayed on the wing.  The captain came in; from the outside preflight; and I told him what I was able to see and not see.  He told me to contact operations about the de-icing that was done and wanted to know what time it was done; we needed deiced; and will it be done at the gate or somewhere else.  I contacted operations and they said de-icing will be done behind the gate in the alley and to contact the deicer about when the fluid was sprayed onto the airplane.  I contacted the deicer and he mentioned it was done early in the morning to help with removal of contaminants.We boarded the airplane; closed the doors; and called for pushback.  Ramp mentioned that it will be some time because a B767 was behind us and getting deiced.  Ramp finally cleared us to pushback and mentioned that we will de-ice in the alley. As we came to the end of our pushback; we noticed the de-ice trucks approaching us.  Then ramp asked if the ground crew can tow us to the top of the alley near TA taxiway.  The conditions were not conducive for a tow.  We asked ramp what they want us to do because there was a great amount of confusion going on the frequency.  One minute we would get de-iced in the alley; then to TA taxiway; then in the alley.  Also; there was additional confusion due to the monitoring of two frequencies; ramp and the deicer.  Ramp finally said to go to TA taxiway and we notified the deicer to meet us at TA.  We disconnected and started both engines to taxi to the de-ice spot.We configured the airplane and notified deicer we were ready for de-ice and anti-ice.  There was a great deal of ice on the airplane especially on the right side.  The process took about 17 minutes.  I was unable to get the employee number who said we were free and clear.  I was able to copy 336***. As we started the engines; a flight attendant contacted the flight deck and the captain answered.  I did not hear the conversation but I did hear the captain mention; at least two times; are you sure it is ice and not foam from the de-ice/anti-ice fluid.  The captain mentioned to me; the flight attendant said she could not see out of ANY of the windows on the right side of the airplane. The captain called the deicer and told him that there is ice on the right side of the airplane and it needs to be checked.  The deicer came back over to the airplane and said they are going to de-ice the airplane again; especially the right side.  We shut down both engines and waited for the de-ice.  The flight attendant was keeping the captain up to date about the progress that was being made on the ice removal on the right side of the airplane.  The captain made the comment to the deicer about bringing in the varsity team because of how bad the job was done the first time.  The deicer made the comment he was putting his better team on the job.  After about 18 minutes; the job was complete and the deicer said we were free and clear.  The captain was in contact with the flight attendant and she said she was able to see out of all windows on the right side of the airplane.We started the engines and proceeded without further incident until climbout when I have never experienced this in my airline career. Starting around 4000 feet (MSL) the captain and I looked at each other in bewilderment. It sounded like we were flying through heavy rain but we were between cloud layers.  I looked at the top of the nose of the airplane and noticed chunks of ice; measuring about 3 inches by 4 inches; flying past.  They were coming up from the bottom of the nose cone and following the slipstream.  The shedding of ice stopped around 8000 feet (MSL).  If it was dark outside; I am not so sure that the flight attendant would have been able to see the ice.What an excellent lesson in CRM.",,,,"A320 First Officer experiences a poor deice job after the aircraft had spent the night in freezing rain.

When I went below the 13;000 feet it was under 4 miles before KEPEC. At the time ATC asked as to verify our altitude; we then realized our altimeter setting was wrong.

Nearing the Top of decent GRU; the arrival and approach were entered and verified in the FMC.   We were cleared for the arrival.  During the decent; ATC issued level off altitudes not on the arrival; and direct clearance to fixes further along the arrival requiring manual intervention several times.  Upon passing the last fix on the arrival; MARPU; aircraft was on speed and at 7000.Turned left and began descent to 5500 for UTKET.   We were cleared for the approach.  Just prior to UTKET; the controller issued 'maintain present heading'.  This was confusing and all three pilots were unsure if we were still cleared to intercept the LOC for the approach of if he intended for us to fly thru the LOC and abandon the intercept.  Pilot Flying engaged heading select which disabled LNAV and unarmed LOC capture.   ATC was asked by Pilot Not Flying if we were cleared for the approach.  ATC replied; 'maintain present heading; cleared for approach; report established'. 4200 feet was set in ALT window as we intercepted the final approach course.  At this point we were high on the profile and visually saw the runway confirming that we were high and needed gear and speed brakes to descend. Auto pilot was disconnected and FLCH selected and a rapid descent was initiated.  Upon reaching the outer marker; AC was on slightly high on the glideslope and slightly fast. After the OM AC continued to slow. However; speedbrakes remained extended; slowing AC below bug speed.  First Officer and FB both verbalized 'airspeed'.  PF corrected and airspeed increased to bug speed.  PF flew PAPI guidance; however was low on the glideslope.  Approx 300 ft PNF verbalized go around.  PF continued approach; but still low on path.  Approx 200 ft PNF verbalized go around.  PF corrected; increased power reduced decent rate continued approach and touched down approximately 1500 to 1800 feet down runway. Normal touchdown.The beginning of the event occurred on the arrival phase of the approach.  The crew had properly programmed; briefed and verified the arrival and approach.  When ATC issued level off altitudes and direct to fix clearances in conflict with the published arrival.  Manual intervention in the FMC was required.  This required the FMC to re-compute the descent path and speed. Removing one level of protection and increasing the workload for the crew.  The FMC was no longer in PATH so extra attention needed to be devoted to altitude and speed control on the arrival. Even after arriving at the final fix on the arrival; on speed and altitude; I felt the extra workload added to accomplish that; made me feel slightly behind the AC.  The next issue occurred after being cleared for the approach; and then told to maintain heading by ATC.  This was confusing for ALL crew.  I went to heading hold.  We now had lost two levels of protection; VNAV and LNAV.  After verifying that we could indeed turn to final; we were behind and now appeared to be high.  The first fix on the final; UTKET; is at 5500 feet; and has the AC 2 dots high on the glideslope.  We need to slow down and go down to intercept the glideslope.  And we need to do it now.  Autopilot off; FLCH; set speed.  Another level of protection gone.  In addition; even though ATC has us in radar contact; they want us to remember to report established.  This request is not necessary and adds more workload to the crew.  And; finally; the tower refuses to clear the AC to land until quite late into the approach. Which adds more stress to the crew. Had ATC respected the arrival as printed; cleared us for the arrival and approach to 9R at the beginning of the arrival as published; I would have been able to leave the automation in LNAV and VNAV and simply monitor and configure until glideslope intercept.  After what ATC did; the briefing we had done prior was pointless.In addition; on the approach plate; 21-5; the plan view of the ILS feather does not match the profile view location of the beginning of the feather.  The profile view is not to scale; and a viewing leads one to interpret UTKET as being just about on the extended glideslope; rather than 2 dots or so above the glideslope it actually is.I suggest a re-design of this arrival and approach to be better suited for RNAV and FMC flight guidance systems. And; a review of all the arrivals and approaches into GRU.  I also suggest that GRU ATC be briefed on the importance of allowing the aircraft to fly the arrival and approach as published.  With emphasis on the programming and briefings the crew is required to accomplish; and that the crew anticipates flying the published arrival.  In addition; the non-standard phraseology and the difficulty understanding someone who's first language is not English; adds to confusion and higher stress for the flight crew. I would also add that the fatigue inherent in flying all night was a factor.",,,,"Captain experiences ATC adding additional restrictions during the RNAV arrival to SBGR and a confusing clearance to intercept the localizer.

ZZZZ was using the south runways for departure; so we taxied out of the ramp single engine; and upon initial contact with ground; we were told we would now depart on runway 09R.  I had the First Officer (FO) immediately start the R engine; and slowed our taxi pace to a crawl.  After engine start; the FO did a great job of changing the FMS for the new runway and SID and recalculating takeoff data. We briefed the changes; which were few; and were at the runway.  We checked to ensure we had five minutes of run time on the second engine; and the FO and I looked at each other and asked if we had done everything we needed to; and decided we had.  The tower gave us line up and wait; and we went into position.  Soon; takeoff clearance came; and I set EPRs to about 1.10; gave the jet to the FO; and he called for standard power. Upon pushing the thrust tile; the auto throttles would not engage.  I checked the auto throttle arm switch armed; pushed thrust once more to no avail; then took the jet to discontinue the takeoff.  Max speed attained was maybe 25 knot (airspeed never came alive).  The takeoff warning horn never sounded because the power levers never went high enough to complete the logic.  Once clear of the runway with the brake set; we discussed the situation; and noticed the flaps were still up--we had failed to configure and run the before takeoff check.  We configured; and confirmed the auto throttles would come on properly once configured; ran the checklist; and departed without further incident.  At its root; this event was caused by human factors issues arising from the time compression associated with the sudden change from a very long taxi for takeoff to the shortest taxi route we can get when leaving ZZZ.  We have standard procedures backed up by checklists to ensure we are properly prepared for each phase of flight. In executing these procedures; we become used to a certain flow of activity as the flight progresses.  One such point in the flow of activity is arrival at the hold short point for takeoff.  Normally; we would have little left to do at this point but receive takeoff clearance; do the below-the-line items on the checklist; and depart.  On this occasion; there was an intense flurry of activity packed into the last couple of hundred meters of taxi to start an engine; recalculate performance data and put it in the FMS; change the runway and SID in the FMS; and re brief the SID.  When it was all done; we were sitting at the hold short line; number one for takeoff; and to our tired minds [in the early AM] local time; this meant the next thing was to go below the line and depart; which we attempted to do.  Thankfully; the aircraft has design features to alert us to being improperly configured for takeoff; and we captured and corrected our error.  The FO and I were aware of the potential for missing something in this dynamic; time compressed situation; as evidenced by our talking about whether we had done everything before we accepted the lineup and wait clearance; yet we still missed crucial steps.  The question is; what can we do in a future situation like this to capture the problem before aircraft systems come to our rescue?  Next time I am in a time compressed situation; I will take a moment to take the checklist in hand and brief from it with the FO whether we have done everything on it.  Trying to do such a review from memory proved ineffective on this occasion; but if I had looked at the checklist itself; it would soon have dawned on us that we had never done the before takeoff checklist; and had not configured.",,,,"B757 Captain reports forgetting to accomplish the before takeoff checklist after planning a very long single engine taxi for takeoff.

The left seat captain was Pilot Not Flying (PNF) and both pilots had a clear visual of the barge and determined it would not present a safety concern to the short final that the aircraft was on; with only a slight deviation from centerline alignment. Pilot flying (PF) altered course slightly to the north of runway 22 and returned to centerline after passing the barge safely. While passing the barge; the Captain observed the wheelhouse off the left wing and below the aircraft. Aircraft landed without apparent incident and taxied into the ramp and shutdown.A line service employee later informed the Captain that the FAA had called about 'missing an aircraft by 100 feet.' Being that there was no other aircraft in the pattern when the crew landed; it seemed like it was another plane. A short while later; the company called and conferenced in a representative from the Tampa Bay Area Coast Guard who advised the Captain that his aircraft had come within 100 feet of a vessel and had 'scared the s**t' out of the pilot in the vessel's wheelhouse. The Captain apologized for any confusion and maintained that the crew had visual contact on the barge and had maneuvered to avoid presenting a hazard to the barge and both crew had extensive knowledge of the boats and vessels that operate in the channel near runway 22. The Coast Guard representative appeared somewhat appeased with the explanation of the events given and reminded the Captain that boats had been hit by planes before; before ending the call.With the channel in such close proximity to the runway and it being the active runway; it would seem it would benefit all parties for vessels transitioning the water to monitor CTAF; and if the barge captain had been; there would have been communication that a Pilatus was landing; had them in sight; and would not present an issue despite the relative proximity of both vessels.",,,,"PC12 Captain reports deviating slightly to the right during a visual approach to Runway 22 at TPF; to avoid a tugboat pushing a barge in the channel.

We were on an intercept heading for the localizer at 3;000 ft. With all anti-icing on; light icing and IMC.  As we intercepted the localizer; the Pilot Flying (PF) remarked 'the numbers are not right'.

At that point I pointed out that I had set Vref on the Standby airspeed indicator at 143 knots. At this point we were fully configured but fast; about 180 knots. The PF asked me to confirm the landing initial page which I was in the process of doing. At some point in the approach the autopilot (AP) and autothrottle (AT) had disconnected but I never heard a disconnect chime for either. We began to slow and were moving high on the Glide Slope which I pointed out to the PF. About this time the AOA was in the yellow arc and as I said 'airspeed' we got a nibble with the stick shaker. The PF added power and accelerated. We were also right of the localizer which I pointed out. The PF mentioned that he was having trouble controlling the airplane's pitch and asked for help pushing. I noticed that the pitch trim was off so we re-engaged it. The PF said lets go around; so he added power and I retracted flaps to 20 degrees. I told tower that we were going around and he gave us runway heading and 4;000 feet. We continued to drift right on our heading which I mentioned to the PF. We were switched to departure and given an altitude of 5;000 feet. As we were passing 4;000 feet we got the annunciation 'PULL UP!!

The clearance we received was 'radar vectors direct to LRP... T295 PRNCE V483 FLIPS.' There were a few difficulties with the clearance. The first one being; our FMS would not recognize 'PRNCE' as being on T295 and the second one was 'FLIPS' was spelled wrong in the clearance and should have been 'FILPS.' After solving these challenges; Tower cleared us for take-off runway 23 and turn direct 'Winchester' [Westminster]. I have not spent much time flying in this area of the country and assume 'Winchester' was the first fix on our clearance 'LRP.' After take-off we made a right turn toward the first fix entered into the FMS. At this time I was starting to think something doesn't sound right. I don't think LRP is 'Winchester.' We then where turned over to departure control. They asked why we turned right. I replied 'because of the military airspace.' Departure said 'do you mean the ARSA' I replied 'yes.' Departure said 'don't do that again.' We were temporarily confused by why they didn't want us turning right; since it was roughly the same degrees of turn either direction. This confirmed that something wasn't quite right so I proceeded to try and verify the identifier for 'Winchester.' Before I was able to look it up; Departure ask 'are you turning direct to Winchester' so; I asked for a vector. Departure said 'turn to heading 130.' I then found the identifier for Winchester (IME) [EMI] and we proceeded to navigate to it.  Soon after this; Departure cleared us to another fix; not on our clearance (I do not recall the fix). I told departure the fix was not on our clearance. There was some more communication between us and departure then suggested they had a different routing for us then the clearance we received.

I don't recall exactly but I am pretty confident it was VFR and OTH was advertising visual approaches.  Just before we took the position; OTH TWR called to request a release on Aircraft X.  The previous controller gave the release without restrictions before beginning the relief briefing.  Aircraft X had a filed route of OTH..UBG..PDX and altitude request of 150.  Aircraft X came up on our frequency 'Out of 800 feet on runway heading.'  The CPC-IT acknowledged and issued the OTH altimeter.  I then immediately keyed up and asked the pilot to verify they were assigned runway heading and which runway they departed.  She responded with 'Affirmative; runway 22.'  We do not have radar to the ground in this area.  Per our LOA; OTH is to assign the routing relayed by Sector 36 in the departure clearance to aircraft.  There is no procedure that allows ZSE or OTH TWR to assign headings on departure.  Only the OTH5 SID; ODP or 'As filed' routing clearances are legal.  A minute later we radar identified Aircraft X approximately 5 miles SW of OTH at about 20.  With the aircraft inside a 30 MIA; I told the CPC-IT to issue Aircraft X 'Leaving 30; cleared direct UBG' to return the aircraft on course ASAP; since they were effectively heading in the opposite direction of their desired course.Another controller from our area had a similar event occur with OTH TWR a few weeks ago but this was my first direct experience.  I was admittedly a bit surprised and initially wasn't sure what to think.  My instinct was to give OTH TWR the benefit of the doubt and assume that the pilot of Aircraft X was somehow mistaken about their clearance.  I eventually decided to call OTH TWR back and tell them that this particular aircraft had come over to us on a runway heading.  The controller replied simply; 'We don't give runway heading' and re-iterated that they issued 'Direct UBG' in this case.  I simply said 'OK' and gave my initials.  In hindsight; the OTH TWR response struck me as a bit odd.  Personally; if I was working at OTH; had issued 'Direct UBG' or 'As filed' to this pilot and the center controller later called to tell me the aircraft come over assigned runway heading I would have likely replied; 'Really?!  That's crazy!  I issued such and such...'  You get the idea.There needs to be a discussion with OTH TWR regarding departure clearances and/or takeoff instructions.  This is unacceptable.",,,,"ZSE Controller describes an aircraft departure procedure that was not followed; and blames the tower for not issuing the correct routing.",

Previously; IFR missed approaches and IFR visual approach go arounds allowed aircraft to be given headings for flight back to SoCal Approach to commence another approach back to land at Burbank.  However; those were taken away (due to minimum vectoring altitudes?) and replaced with the published missed approach or to remain in the traffic pattern at Burbank.  The published missed approach takes aircraft right into the arrival approach into Burbank; so if SoCal Approach is not protecting for a missed approach; two aircraft are going to be pointed at each other.As for visual approaches into Burbank; controllers are strongly encouraged to keep aircraft in the traffic pattern instead of sending them back to SoCal Approach.  This is more easily accomplished with slower non turbo jet aircraft.  The fast jets however have turning radii that take them outside of Burbank airspace.  For instance; a [air carrier large jet] going around on an approach to runway 33 must make left traffic back to runway 33 (right traffic is not permitted to due terrain).  This air carrier will enter Whiteman Airport airspace (WHP) and Van Nuys Airport airspace (VNY).  Normally a pilot of the [air carrier large jet] needs from 3.5 to 6 miles in radius for the pattern. This means the [air carrier large jet] will be very close to arrivals and departures out of Van Nuys.  If Van Nuys has an IFR aircraft in or out at the wrong time; basic IFR separation could be lost.  At the same time; a visual approach go around off runway 8 requires right traffic back to runway 8 (again due to terrain) and may put the aircraft in close proximity to Van Nuys depending on how tightly the pilot can maneuver the airplane. Keeping large; fast moving; wide turning jets in the pattern puts them too close to Van Nuys traffic. The headings (same as on the SIDs) used prior to the new procedures allowed the aircraft to be directed away from sequential arrivals and traffic at Van Nuys.  Go arounds off runway 8 were given turn right to heading 210 (which is what departures got).  This kept the go around away from the next arrival into Burbank and Van Nuys traffic.  A coordinated turn right heading 120 also gave controllers another out if there was a slow moving IFR departure on a 210 heading before the go around.Go arounds off runway 33 were given turn left heading 270.  This kept them away from the next Burbank arrival and further away from Van Nuys airport.  In past experience; I have had a [air carrier large jet] go around on runway 33 that made left traffic back to runway 33 with a turn so wide that he flew the downwind about 1 mile east of Van Nuys airport at 3000 MSL.",,,,"BUR Tower Controller reports of inadequate procedures for missed approach/go-around aircraft and the conflictions related to aircraft going missed approach/go-around.",

The gate agent informed me that there was no dispatch paperwork available and the aircraft was parked remotely off the gate; and that we would have to wait for it to be positioned at the gate by the ramp crew. At 30 mins prior; the plane was finally brought to the gate. Also; the dispatch paperwork was provided at approximately this same time. Upon reaching the aircraft; we found the aircraft was being fueled; and therefore we could not power up the aircraft until the fueling was complete per SOPs. I informed the gate of this minor delay in boarding and told them that we would board as soon as we could power up the aircraft to do our preflight. A few mins later; as fueling was completed I powered up the aircraft and we were beginning our preflight when a second gate agent walked onto the plane and demanded to know why we were not ready to board! I informed this new person of the late aircraft positioning by the ramp and of the fueling delay. As soon as we could board; we did; and all the passengers were on the plane 9-10 mins prior to departure; so we were in good shape to make an on time departure. The gate agent informed the Flight Attendant (FA) that all the passengers were on board so she began her physical passenger count. I continued my preflight duties and was looking through the paperwork when I looked out the window and realized the jet bridge had been pulled away from the aircraft. I then turned around to see the FA helping passengers and finishing her count in the middle of the aircraft. Because this aircraft had a plug door without stairs; I recognized what I believed to be a serious safety issue with the door open and no bridge attached. So I got out of the cockpit and pulled the Main Cabin Door into the closed position to keep anyone from inadvertently falling onto the ramp. I then called OPS and queried them about why the jet bridge had been pulled away from the aircraft without any communication with the flight crew. Their response was that they 'are understaffed' Moments later; a ramp agent came and slammed the handle down from outside the aircraft. I again got out of the cockpit and opened the door to have a discussion with this ramp agent to inform him of my safety concern of him slamming the door handle from the outside; and showed him the inside door handle that could have broke the FA's arm if she had had her hand on it at the same time.The main concern of the ramp agents and gate agents was to get the aircraft out on time; with little regard for the crew or the passengers' safety. About this time the FA asked me if the gate agent had given us a passenger count to confirm with her count. So I had to now contact OPS to ask for the passenger count to confirm with the FA's count because the gate agent pulled the jet bridge before confirming the count as we usually do.As I settled back into my cockpit duties to continue with my paperwork; I reviewed an MEL on the release that required the flight crew to physically check that the baggage door was secured from outside; so I immediately called OPS and requested the jet bridge be brought back to the aircraft to complete this task. This was 5 mins prior to departure; I was told to 'standby'. When OPS responded on the radio about a minute later; I was told that they would not reposition the bridge until I gave them a valid reason; and so I informed them of the MEL procedure that needed to be accomplished. It took another 3 mins for them to move the jet bridge back to the aircraft. When I got into the jet bridge; I was confronted by a male gate agent who appeared to be a Lead; but was not wearing a red coat. He proceeded to tell me that I was 'inconveniencing 46 passengers on the plane!' The ramp supervisor was there too; and I explained to him the MEL and my need to physically confirm the baggage door per the MEL. Heagreed and immediately accommodated me; walking with me down the jet bridge stairs and to the bag door. He was THE ONLY PERSON from the whole ground operation who was willing to help me keep the process moving! Unfortunately; by the time he personally had gotten involved; the safety issues had already been dealt with and we were now a late departure.The station operation team needs to understand that communication with the flight crew prior to removing a jet bridge from an airplane is vital to SAFETY. I don't think it is ever safe to have passengers on board an aircraft without stairs and an unmonitored door! I also think that in the interest of security; the gate agent needs to be in the jet bridge next to the airplane until the passenger count can be verified with the flight crew. Safety and Security ALWAYS needs to be placed above an on time departure! Also; if there is a safety or security concern raised with OPS; the ramp supervisor should immediately make himself available to the flight crew to attempt to resolve the situation.",,,,"An EMB-145 Captain narrates a distressing breakdown in teamwork between ground personnel versus flight and cabin crews in a dispute over whether to work together to follow the rules--and regulations--for a safe and legal operation or to just get the jet out of the gate on time.",

NOTAM numbers AZZZZ/ZZ and AYYYY/YY restrict Cat D aircraft from conducting S-ILS 33L and 4R.  The crew called for clarification about these NOTAMs.  I contacted BOS Airport Authority for clarification as to why Cat D aircraft are prohibited from the approach but other Category aircraft are not.  Airport Authority/operations had no knowledge of these NOTAMs.  I also contacted BOS tower who also indicated they had no knowledge of these NOTAMs and further indicated that as far as they were concerned the only limitation was that the CAT 2 and CAT 3 approaches were not available due to snow build up around the approach lights.  The tower indicated as far as they were concerned the ILS CAT 1 approach was available.  Having received this information from the tower I assumed the NOTAM to be invalid and advised the crew of what I had learned via phone prior to departing.  I thought that with the extremely numerous number of NOTAMs in effect for BOS that perhaps this NOTAM should have been closed out but had somehow not been.  I later learned this was not the case.  The flight operated without incident.  I learned the following day that the crew flew the ILS 33 approach based on information I had provided.The following evening I had the same flight.  While planning the flight I noticed the same two NOTAMs still in the system.  I again contacted the BOS airport authority for information or clarification.  A different person tonight also had no knowledge of the NOTAM and was of no help.  I decided to try and dig a little deeper and try and find out where the NOTAMs are coming from if not the airport authority.  I contacted the Watch Supervisor at ZBW.  I explained the situation and what had taken place with tower and airport authority.  The ZBW supervisor was able to pull up the NOTAMs by the NOTAM numbers.  He did a lot of research and eventually determined the NOTAMs where valid.  He advised that the NOTAMs originated out of an FAA office in Oklahoma City and that it was his understanding that any time there is 6 inches or more of snow on the ground that ILS approaches can be affected.  He was a tremendous help and spent a lot of time tracking down the information.A number of questions come to mind:How can both the airport authority and tower have no knowledge of a NOTAM that effects an approach procedure at their airport?If 6 inches of snow can; in fact; impact the approach procedure to this degree why is this not a NOTAM that we see all the time?Why would this only effect Cat D aircraft?If a tower controller says there are no limitations on an approach but we have a NOTAM that says something different which do we follow?  It is not uncommon for tower controllers to have different information.I thought I was exercising due diligence in contacting the tower and airport authority only to; apparently; be lead down the wrong path.  For flights the next day I advised the crew not to accept an ILS33 approach and instead to plan for a RNAV (GPS) RWY 33L if an instrument approach is needed.  I would have done the same for the flight in question had I been given accurate information from the airport authority and tower.",,,,"A Dispatcher was confused as to the application of NOTAMed limitations on low minimum ILS approaches for BOS and contacted BOS ATC for clarification.

I immediately released my 5 point and exited aircraft. I ran to rear of Aircraft but was in fear it would impact; so I dove under Aircraft belly and managed to dive in truck and slam on the break. I broke my glasses and ripped my uniform but fortunately was able to stop the truck about a foot from tail skid and fuselage.

Upon reaching the final fix on the IGONO 1A arrival; GG422; [GG408] no further clearance or vector received.  Followed RNAV arrival track on ILS Z 02R; which was a right turn to fix GG40Y; the IF for the approach.  While we were in the turn toward a track of 286; ATC issued the following: 'Callsign ZZZ turn left immediately heading 180 due to traffic.' The first officer (FO) was flying; and immediately disconnected the autopilot and manually turned the aircraft to the assigned heading. We were then vectored to the ILS 02R.Approaching fix GG408; we were expecting a vector to the ILS; based on previous experience and traffic conditions at the time. There is no note on the arrival about what to expect after that fix if no further clearance is issued.  The first officer and I discussed and agreed that in the event of no vector; the RNAV right turn would be what ATC was expecting.  I suspect now; that the controller intended to give us a vector; but for some reason did not.  The technically correct clearance for what we did should have included a clearance for the ILS Z 02R. The problem is that in China; we get used to operating in a world of ambiguous clearances and difficult communications.  It is normal for a clearance to be issued at the last possible moment.  An example is that at both Shanghai and Guangzhou; it is a common occurrence to be within one minute of the initial arrival fix before receiving the clearance for the actual STAR we are expected to fly.  In this case; we were faced with a question of 'what is he really expecting us to do?' There is no really clear answer.  If the fix GG408 was actually a clearance limit; then the technically correct answer is to enter a hold at that point.  That was obviously not what was expected.   For my part; the faint warning bells that accompany ambiguous clearances were beginning to sound.  I should have queried the controller on what he wanted us to do after GG408.  Instead; I assumed that in the event of no further clearance; I was expected to follow the RNAV to the expected runway.  This was not the case.  I believe the controller momentarily forgot about us. We don't think in terms of the controller making a mistake.  I hesitated to question the controller partly due to the fact that the charted ILS Z (RNAV) approach to 02R seemed to be the only reasonable alternative to vectors.  I was thinking in terms of 'well; he must have meant to clear us for the approach from the arrival.'  Bottom line: when I became uncomfortable with the ambiguity; I should have communicated my concerns to the approach controller.",,,,"Air Carrier Captain arriving ZGGG via the IGONO 1A arrival Runway 02R reports reaching the final point on the arrival (GG408) and absent instructions from ATC; continues with RNAV connection to the ILS Z 02R.

There may have also been a wind shear advisory on the ATIS. The Captain decided to change the takeoff thrust setting and use TOGA. I asked if he would also like to use Flaps 2. He said yes and I requested Flaps 2 takeoff data from the ACARS. While I was doing this the Captain began reprogramming the Perf page by entering 2 in the Flap setting. When we received the Takeoff data; we had a long discussion about what speeds he wanted for takeoff. He decided to use the Max thrust V-speeds for V1 and Vr and a speed of 142 for rotate. This speed was well below the 154 Vr maximum listed on the data; but he chose it because it matched the 10 knot tailwind Vr for a reduced takeoff (I guess this is his technique). I programmed the speeds into the Perf page and shortly thereafter we departed 4L; rotating at 142 knots. At 800 feet AFE; upon power reduction; the Captain noticed and stated that the flaps were still at position 1 and that we had never set Flaps 2. We discussed what had occurred and compared the speeds we had used with the Flaps 1 data. It appeared that we rotated 4 knots below the rotate speed for Flaps 1 reduced; but I didn't think to compare it to the Vr speed on the TOGA thrust line for the Flaps 1 data.The error was that we did not comply with the flight manual and repeat the Before Takeoff Checklist after repositioning a flight control.

This resulted in a go around and we tried another attempt to land. On the second approach; ATC issued a microburst alert; resulting in another go around. While performing the go around; we received another windshear warning. At this point it was obvious we were not going to get into ZZZ and decided to return to the departure airport. While on the way; we realized that the airport had switched to a northbound operation which caused us to show a landing fuel of under 1500 lbs. Reserve on this flight was 2200 lbs. We then decided due to the low fuel; our only option was to land in GSP. While on the way; we showed landing with under 2200 lbs of fuel and declared min fuel to ATC. The conditions in GSP were not much different than in ZZZ or the departure airport; reporting windshear on final and other aircraft that had previously had to go around. As we were becoming critically low on fuel and multiple passengers were vomiting in the back; it was clear that we needed to land urgently. While on final; we received another windshear warning between 1000-1500 feet. I made the decision to continue the approach and not go around as we had no other options and only one go around could possibly be done with the critically low fuel. I wanted to make sure I had the go around available to me if it became necessary to save the aircraft while critically low over the runway; so I made the PIC decision to fly through the windshear warning as we were still flying and had some altitude to work with. We ended up landing safely in GSP with 2000 lbs of fuel on board and the wind conditions rapidly deteriorating. This event occurred due to the windshear conditions at all the airports in the area. We appeared to have plenty of fuel on board when we left and as there was no real convective activity along the route; I was under the impression that the flight would be windy; but nothing too out of the ordinary. The second attempt into ZZZ and the subsequent turning around of the departure airport also compounded the issue. My decision to continue through the windshear event in GSP was caused by the lack of fuel and lack of options available at the time and I feel it was necessary to be done to safely get the aircraft and the passengers on the ground while still having a little fuel left over in case of an extreme emergency close to the ground.This can be prevented by not sending airplanes into the air with a smaller fuel load when extreme windshear and microburst conditions are present at nearly all the available airports in the area. However; the conditions deteriorated rapidly and there may not have been enough warning to plan for multiple failed approaches and a subsequent diversion.",,,,"CRJ Captain describes a diversion caused by a windshear on the first approach and a microburst alert from ATC on the second.

There have been disputes between Taiwan and China over airspace so I assumed this might be the case or it might be because we were crossing major north-south airways and we were required to descend to avoid conflict.   There was a note on the FPR about not climbing above FL 270 but it further said to reference Fly Safe NOTAM. That reference said if I was flying between certain cities .. AND .. I was also using certain airways; then it applied. I was not flying between said cities so I determined the NOTAM was not applicable.   In cruise; when Taipei ATC did not mandate a descent to a lower altitude; I notified Dispatch. Their response was to reference the FPR and thus the NOTAM already mentioned. The dispatcher further communicated via ACARS that 'ATC had good information about your capabilities. It is their decision as to how they will safely separate aircraft from that point. However; if at any time you feel they put you in a compromising position reference the NOTAM; [a safety report] is your feedback tool'. Aircraft were constantly passing above and below us so I assumed ATC couldn't descend us even if they wanted to because of the traffic. There was nothing in the NOTAM or ATC's actions that gave me concern or made me feel my safety had been compromised.  Shortly after passing APU; we were cleared direct to ATOTI waypoint. This meant we were not on any airway so; again; the NOTAM didn't apply.  The NOTAM system has been known to be flawed for a long time. In the past; management comments have stated they are aware and intended to fix the problem. The reality is that this hasn't happened. While a pilot may not fly a given route more than once per year; someone is looking at airports; airways; NOTAMS; etc. every single day. They become the subject matter experts. That is where someone should be assigned to monitor issues that are relevant to a given route and decide to delete information that is useless (and thus a distraction) while emphasizing information that is important. India is the worst but most any airport/route could be a candidate. Until management elects to make this a safety of flight issue; NOTAMS will remain a weak point in our flight operations.  I suggest Dispatch employ resources to make real improvements in the way NOTAMS are provided to flight crew so all can get to the meat of the matter without having to read things about landing fees; fish delivery flights being restricted; etc. In the general aviation world; NOTAMS are broken down into categories such as: Runways; Nav Aids; Taxiways; etc. Not all our flights are conducted in areas where computers and internet are available prior to departing. Many international flights require preflight duties to take place in the cockpit. We are behind in making NOTAMS easier to sift through when we have a limited amount of time to read all the documentation required to conduct a given flight. We are attempting to read reams of paperwork in a cockpit 'office' while maintenance; immigrations; ramp leaders; etc. are coming in and distracting the crew. I don't think [the company] could design a better environment for distractions if they tried. While some aspects of the pre-departure environment can never be controlled; there continue to be missed opportunities to mitigate the pre-departure chaos. Management has apparently elected to pass on the responsibility of dealing with this to the crew in lieu of taking steps to support the crew through actions such as NOTAM improvements.",,,,"The Captain of a wide body cargo aircraft addressed his concerns over the massive quantities and difficulties associated with reviewing; understanding; digesting; and implementing the overwhelming number of items associated with long range flight planning.

The First Officer (FO) was the pilot flying (PF). The aircraft takeoff weight was approximately 46;500 lbs. with a flap setting of 20 degrees; a trim setting of 7.8; and the use of reduced thrust. The airport weather was clear and the wind was reported at 3 knots; so almost calm.  During this event the stick shaker activated and the aural stall warbler tone was heard.  In my opinion; the circumstances of the event were induced by the combined effect of an aggressive pitch rate during rotation and encountering significant wake turbulence and propeller slipstream effects from the preceding departing aircraft within 100 to 200 feet above the runway during our initial climb. The following is a detailed description of the pertinent facts and timeline:The aircraft preceding our flight in the takeoff sequence was a Bombardier Q400.  When the Q400 was cleared for takeoff; our flight was instructed to line up and wait on the same runway. Once we were aligned with the runway and the Q400 was airborne our flight was almost immediately cleared for takeoff. The FO accepted control of our aircraft and began a reduced thrust takeoff roll.  The takeoff roll was normal up to the rotation point. When the FO began to rotate the aircraft (i.e. pitch the nose upward); the pitch rate was aggressive and not typical. I would not say that I was alarmed; but I was definitely surprised.  The initial climb rate was rapid up to between 100 and 200 feet above the runway at which time we began to encounter significant destabilizing wake turbulence and; I suspect; propeller slipstream effects from the preceding Q400.  The turbulence encounter initially induced uncommanded roll excursions of up to 20 degrees left and right.  Within roughly 2 seconds after the roll excursions began; the stick shaker activated and immediately after the stick shaker activated the stall warbler tone was heard for 1 to 2 seconds; after which all stall warning indications and roll excursions ceased.  So; the entire encounter was perhaps 5 seconds; where the low speed event comprised the last 3 of those 5 seconds.  The lowest airspeed I observed during this time was about 15 knots above the low speed checkerboard; but I was not fixated on the airspeed alone; and I believe the airplane continued to climb throughout the event. We continued to encounter definite; but more benign; wake turbulence disturbances through at least 1;500 feet above the runway elevation at which point we entered smooth air.The following are additional items I either noticed or did not notice. (1) In spite of an aggressive takeoff rotation; the aircraft was not pitched beyond the initial command bar guidance designated by activation of the TOGA button prior to the takeoff roll.  (2) The CRJ FCOM states that the stick pusher and stall switch/lights illuminate in conjunction with the stall warbler tone. I did not see the stall switch/lights illuminate; nor did I observe the stick pusher; and the FO stated to me that he did not feel the stick pusher activate.  (3) The FO stated to me after the event that he had reduced pitch slightly when the stick shaker activated.  While I do not question his assertion; I did not perceive his action at the time.  (4) During this event; the engine thrust remained at the FLEX setting which was a deficiency in our response.  When the stall warning system activated; it was my expectation that the FO would increase the engine thrust. However; by the time I realized the degree to which he was focused on manipulating the flight controls in the wake turbulence; the event had passed and aircraft control was no longer compromised. In this situation I should not have waited; but instead I should have immediately advanced the engine thrust to maximum as soon as it became apparent that the PF would not do so.  (5) I certainly did not realize; and I believe that my FO agrees; that the wakeand slipstream effects from a Q400 could be so significant to a CRJ.I believe that the instability induced by the wake turbulence encounter when combined with the aggressive aircraft pitch rate described previously were together the root cause for the aircraft's stall warning system to activate.  I also believe that if these two factors were to have been encountered separately that it is plausible that the stall warning system might not have activated. This is not to discount any personal responsibility in managing the aircraft; but rather to make clear the effect of combined factors. Contributing factors include underestimating the magnitude of aircraft wake compared to the size of the aircraft and therefore being less prepared for a wake turbulence encounter; and being complacent about the professional performance of crew members.I consider the FO who worked this flight to be professional in the execution of his duties and I have flown with him on many occasions over several years. When flying with a familiar person who also has considerable experience over the same routes and from the same airports; it is easier to adopt the mindset that your coworker will be unlikely to do something which is unexpected. In my case this in turn enhances the chance that I will make a mistake through casual assumptions and failing to 'keep my guard up'.  When I asked the FO afterwards if he noticed that his rotation rate was overly aggressive; he admitted that it could have been; but did not categorically state that it was.  From now on I will always take this type of scenario more seriously and address the issue of crew familiarity and its impact on flight safety during the crew briefing where applicable. Through this event I now have a greater regard for the need to apply proactive measure both in discussion and in acting as the pilot monitoring (and PF) based on what I see; and not what I expect.",,"On takeoff at approx. 300 feet we encountered wake turbulence from a Dash Q400 that departed prior to us.  The stall warbler and shaker activated for 2 seconds approx. then silenced once we flew through the shear.  We encountered turbulence from the Dash on and off through 1;100. Remainder of the climb-out was normal.Root cause was departing right after a Q400 and encountering prop wash and their wake.  Perhaps a rotation too fast into the c-bars might have been a contributing factor.Be aware of wake and prop wash from a Dash!! Smaller aircraft can disturb the air as well as larger aircraft! On rotation a smooth pitch into the C bars as well will lessen the wake turbulence recovery.",,"CRJ-200 flight crew reported encountering wake turbulence in trail of a Q400 on takeoff from LAX that resulted in a momentary stick shaker.",

A gusting wind caused a right turn (weather vane effect) on the icy taxiway. I applied left tiller and both brakes to correct the taxi-line deviation. The aircraft tiller and brakes were ineffective at first. The nosewheel finally rolled onto a portion of the taxiway that was not as icy and caused a rapid turn back toward the taxiway centerline and on around to where the aircraft had completed a 180 degree turn while remaining on the taxiway. At no time did the aircraft leave the taxiway.We stopped the aircraft and called ground to have the airport authority send someone out to give the aircraft an exterior inspection on the taxiway to determine if we could taxi back to the gate under the aircraft's own power. He saw no damage and provided hand signal guidance to ensure that we could turn back around. (Another aircraft was headed our direction on Lima to runway 06R). With tower clearance we taxied down the runway and returned to the gate. Maintenance performed an engine Ice/FOD inspection and signed off the logbook write-up.

It's hard to visualize what's happening in the back and the two females [flight attendants] and lead wanted to divert and take this person off the plane. In order to divert and what they don't understand is they had no clue where we were and how much fuel we had.I asked for male flight attendant and asked him what was happening and he said the guy was just drunk and talking junk.  I asked him if we need to divert and he told me that he calmed the guy down and not a big deal. I along with my First Officer (FO) have flown with this flight attendant many times and I trust him and know he does a great job. The other three FA I don't know but I sensed drama. After we diverted and removed both deportees; we took off and went to ZZZ about one and half hours late. When we got off plane and went to the hotel; I talked to a PAX that was on our plane and sitting in front of deportee. ...we talked for several minutes about what happened and he confirmed what I thought.  He told me that the male FA and a female PAX from Canada would get [deportee] calmed down; and as soon as he was calm [one of the female flight attendants] would tell him to be quiet; and if the female PAX (that was calming [the deportee]) doesn't get back to her seat; that she would be locked up as well. [PAX added that] when a person is drunk like this and an FA gets verbal with a drunk PAX; it starts all over again.I told the lead and both female FA to stay away from this drunk person and let [the male FA] calm him down.  Also; this deportee never hit anyone he was just verbal. This went on for several minutes and we finally declared an emergency and diverted too [a convenient airport] where both deportees were removed. I didn't make a PA stating that we are [doing so] because I thought the drunk would go on a rampage if he knew what we had planned.

The maintenance action taken for that item has been: Bite Check Fuel Processor No Faults Found. Replaced EICAS Sign Consolidation Card Ref MM31-XX-XX. The crew spoke to Dispatch and Maintenance Control and inquired about the system.  Maintenance Control had no information and could not suggest anything other than to recite the same write-up we had. The crew asked for a copy of the maintenance procedure; and was told to speak to local maintenance. Line maintenance provided a copy of the procedure and the associated wiring diagram; 767 Wiring Diagram Manual; but did not know anything about the repair. Note: There was also a chronic write up involving the Aft Galley FA system constantly chiming. All systems were perfectly normal on preflight and departure.  We departed with 98.1 Fuel On Board at the gate. At cruise altitude the flight attendants reported that the FA Galley system again had a repetitive chime which could not be extinguished. After contacting Dispatch and Maintenance Control; the crew performed the Maintenance Control recommended reset maneuver of depowering and repowering buttons on the Forward FA panel. This solved the problem for a short while but had to be repeated throughout the flight; as the incessant chiming reappeared. After several hours of flying; while still in ETOPS airspace; a status message appeared which indicated Fuel Channel Failure.  There were no other immediate malfunctions. The crew compared Totalizer vs. Calculated Fuel on Progress Page 2 of the FMC units; and they indicated approximately 30.5lbs of fuel remaining; between both main tanks.  The center tank was empty.  Within a few minutes; all fuel quantity indications disappeared from the overhead panel; and the Totalizer Fuel number disappeared from Progress Page 2. After reviewing the QRH; and the 767 Flight Manual; and finding no procedure for or reference to a Fuel Quantity Indication failure; the crew contacted Dispatch and Maintenance Control on SATCOM.  Maintenance Control noted the log history but could not provide any help; other than to suggest that the problem might correct itself; 'usually it just comes back'. The crew asked Maintenance Control if there was any other method to determine the quantity of fuel in the tanks; in order to rule out a fuel leak.  He didn't know and just suggested reading the Fuel Leak Procedure in the Flight Manual.  The crew advised they had read that procedure; referenced it; and asked again if there was any way to monitor the fuel quantity (other than visual external inspection) to verify the absence of a fuel leak.  Maintenance Control did not know of anything and did not seem to understand the question. Dispatch did not have any suggestions either. After reviewing the passenger manifest and determining that there were no deadheading pilots on board; the crew briefed the Purser on the situation.  The First Officer (FO) then went back; made a visual inspection; and saw no sign of fuel leak.  The FO also spoke to the flight attendants in the aft section of the airplane and enlisted the help of one of the FAMs who was seated in a window seat; to monitor the situation and advise if they noticed anything.The Captain reviewed the wiring diagram the relevance of Air/GND Signal 1 and Air/GND Signal 2 in relation to the FUEL QTY INDicators; and specifically the history of the Status message appearing; or disappearing after landing.  There were no indications of an air/ground sensing problem nor any C.B.s popped. Maintenance Control sent an ACARS message wondering if the problem had fixed itself yet. After reviewing the situation internally; the crew decided the  safest course of action was to press on to destination; continuing to monitor; but not to accept any delays; such as holding;due to the inability to determine fuel on board; and therefore make a proper risk assessment of holding delays. Dispatch advised that they would coordinate with ZZZ control to insure there were no delays into ZZZ. When the crew checked in with [next ATC] control; they advised that they would not be able to accept any delays into ZZZZ. Shortly thereafter; Flight was switched to [another ATC] control.  The controller gave a frequency change to speak to an ATC supervisor.  The ATC supervisor inquired into the exact problem; and the crew advised that all systems were normal; except for the loss of fuel quantity indications. The ATC controller advised that the flight would have to declare a PAN or a Fuel Emergency in order to avoid holding in ZZZZ.  The Captain declared a PAN; and confirmed that we required no additional assistance at that time. Shortly thereafter; Dispatch sent a message advising that he had spoken to ZZZZ; and the only way to avoid holding was to declare an emergency; which he advocated doing. The Captain called Dispatch on the SATCOM and tried to clarify whether a PAN or a Fuel Emergency was required to meet ZZZZ ATC requirements. The Dispatcher wasn't sure; and the Captain confirmed that we want to do whatever ZZZZ ATC wants for their airspace.' Meanwhile; ATC was giving us preferential handling; including two or three 'short cuts' with direct clearances through their airspace.  After waiting over 10 minutes and still not receiving clarification from Dispatch; flight declared [our fuel situation with ATC]; but confirmed that they needed no assistance other than an absence of delays. The Captain and flying First Officer brought the resting FO back to the cockpit early to involve him in the situation.   The crew briefed and prepared early for the ILS XXL approach into ZZZZ. There was some discussion of reference speeds; and the veracity of the information on the FMC. All crewmembers compared the landing speeds  references on the FMC against the expected values based on takeoff weight; known fuel on board at takeoff; less burn; and came up with values consistent with the FMC reference page. We had an uneventful approach; landing; and taxi to the gate.  At the gate with the parking brake set; and the parking checklist complete; the fuel quantity indications still were inoperative. While waiting for the jetway driver to appear; the fuel quantity indications reappeared and indicated approximately 20.1 pounds on board; and the FUEL QTY CHANNEL status message disappeared. The crew had previously requested that the fuel tanks be dripped in order to obtain accurate remaining fuel quantity indications for maintenance and the next crew.   Hopefully; this will be helpful to maintenance in evaluating the problem.",,,,"B767 Captain reports being dispatched in an aircraft that has had numerous previous write up concerning the fuel quantity indication system.

The cowl plug was discovered after we wrote up the aircraft for a large torque split and abnormal engine indications in flight. There are many holes in the Swiss cheese as they say that aligned to make this happen including; fatigue; weather; time pressure; operational hazards/considerations and poor dispatch/scheduling coordination all of which will be discussed.My day started at late evening. Our flight was delayed to three hours waiting for an inbound aircraft. Upon meeting the aircraft the previous crew had written up the crew O2; passenger placard; and right side nav light. This further delayed our night to another hour. The flight was not entirely uneventful. Prior to our descent the captain got the weather and while there was a high overcast layer the ground visibility was right at the minimums for the approach and the captain being high mins. To add; light snow and 30+ kts winds on the surface created a ground blizzard of sorts. The captain elected to contact dispatch to discuss the situation and weather with them. Our conversation with dispatch had to be relayed by another crew because dispatch could not hear us. The captain and dispatch concurred that we were still able to shoot the approach. On approach we were able to see the airport and approach lights quite far out and continued our descent to landing well after midnight.After deplaning and closing up the aircraft; we waited for a taxi to pick us up since the hotel shuttle was not operating at that time of night. During this time the captain was talking with scheduling to figure out how our late arrival would affect our morning. Our concern was we were infringing on our 3 hours of scheduled rest and that we were going to revert to a continuous duty overnight and table B making the morning flight very tight to get back to our base. The first two calls to scheduling were met by reassurance that there would be no effect because travel time was part of the 3 hours of rest. The captain and I did not agree and had referenced FAR Part 117.15(b). Scheduling refused to look up the regulation and discuss further. The third scheduler agreed to look up the regulation and then realized we would be infringing on our 3 hours of rest. He said to call when we got to the hotel and he would adjust our rest; delay the morning flight and we would still be afforded the 14 hour duty day. We got to the hotel at well after midnight and called scheduling. They said they moved our rest time. The captain and I agreed but both felt something was not quite right. Once in my hotel room and reread the 117 rules and realized our new plan didn't comply with 117.15(a). I spoke with the captain and he called scheduling again and it was decided that we would be on continuous duty and our duty would revert to table B making us only legal to sometime before mid-morning. I felt if I slept I would be much more tired feeling then if I stayed up or just took a short nap. I decided to watch a TV show and did doze off for about 25 minutes. Upon reaching the airport the captain got his morning brief and dispatch didn't seem concerned about our tight time getting to our destination. Upon questioning; dispatch knew nothing about our situation and thought we were still good for an additional about 4 hours. After a conversation with scheduling the captain was told we need to accept an extension or the flight would be canceled. The captain and [I] did not agree with this because there were not unforeseen circumstances at that point. While some of the things the previous night may not have been foreseen; as we currently were with no delays there was nothing unforeseen. We said if something came up we would consider an extension but at that moment we would not accept one. They agreed to let the flight go as scheduled.I did my normal first flight of the day walk around. However I did my walk around at a brisk pace with temperature near zero degrees and winds still gusting; wind chills would be well below zero. During my preflight I did not notice the cowl plugs in either cowl. The cowl bag hung in the cargo compartment although I did not look inside the bag to see if the plugs were in it. The only abnormal area I noted was the crew O2 was back down to 1200 PSI after just being filled the night prior.During startup; while deicing and while running checklist prior to takeoff I noticed no anomalies in the engine indications. The first indication that something wasn't right occurred during the takeoff roll when the captain said set power. With the power levers relatively close together the right side was producing 100% torque and the left was around 80%. I advanced the left power lever to match the torque on the right. At about 500 feet I looked down and again the torque was at 80% with the right engine producing 96%. The captain pushed the power lever forward to bring the torques closer together. At this time we noticed the NH and NL were near 100%; the ITT was high; and the fuel flow was about 200lbs per hour greater than the right. We elected to operate the engine in the 80% to 90% range to keep the other engine parameters in normal limits and continue to destination. During this decision making process we did look at recent trends and noted that the left engine had higher NL; NH; Fuel Flow and ITT in recent days. The rest of the flight and ground operation were uneventful. I did not do a post flight walk around as the next crew had already come out to the plane. As the first officer it is my job to make sure the exterior of the aircraft is in an adequate condition to perform a safe flight; and while we safely landed I failed to do that. It is my normal routine to look in both cowls on every preflight and I believe I did that on this flight.I have been told the cowl plugs are black; this would make them difficult to see whether they were in place or lying down in the air intake. The cowl plugs should be a bright color as to easily be seen. I have seen the cowl plugs used maybe twice before. Because they are not something we frequently use during the winter; a cowl plug lying down out of direct line of sight would be easily over looked. I am also not sure why one cowl plug would be used or if both were used why both weren't put away. Arbitrary use of cowl plugs is also an issue. It should be during winter months at our stations cowl plugs are put in on every RON aircraft. This way there is an expectation of them to be there. Do to the weather and our wheels up time we were in a rush to be the first to the deice pad; as the day prior we spent about 40 minutes on the ground waiting to be deiced. Had this occurred again we would have not made our wheels up time. Lastly the issues with scheduling and dispatch not communicating and not knowing the standup rules cause a great deal of extra stress that shouldn't have been put on us. We were spending rest time and time prior to boarding looking up stand up and extension regulations to make sure things were done correctly.",,,,"Following a continuous duty overnight; a DHC-8 First Officer failed to see a left engine cowl plug in place during his walkaround in very cold weather. The fatigued crew operated the flight after the plug was ingested noting only lower torque and higher fuel flow.",

Since the RVR is a reported measurement and the Tower visibility is subjective after discussion amongst ourselves we completed the cockpit inspection of the wings; finished our checklist; and departed without incident.

All other markings have been painted appropriately but not the space for the fuel cart. I called the Chief Pilot on Call and we discussed the problem. We referred to FOM. This is somewhat ambiguous as to how to handle a fuel cart in the Safety Zone.  It doesn't refer to anything other than obstructions. Apparently in the Ground Ops manual; it refers to the proper marking of these carts. In a previous flight at a different airport; that I can't remember; I have seen a belt loader parked in the zone between a painted yellow line and the boundary line of the Safety Zone. On that occasion; we had the belt loader removed before taxi in. This however brings up a broader issue of what exactly is allowed in the Safety Zone and how they should be marked. Fuel carts are in the Safety Zone at many gates across the system yet they are not referred to in the FOM nor are the appropriate markings.The FOM needs to be updated to be very clear as to what is acceptable in the Safety Zone and what markings are required.

Also; my iPad did not have a single VOR approach in it. Only the FO's iPad had the VOR approach. We confirmed that the radials and altitudes on the approach were the same; so we continued the approach.

We were both somewhat confused about the warning as we could see the top of the hill and per procedure cleared to 8400 feet on the turn inbound. I turned off the autopilot and stopped the descent rate and climbed a few hundred feet. As soon as I stopped the descent the warning went away. We could only assume that it was the descent rate with open descent selected on the mode control panel that caused the warning. In any case; that certainly was a very confusing warning as per procedure you are cleared to 8400 feet on the turn inbound to the ILS.

Having experienced this on a 767; I recognized the smell; but it was worse; and in that previous incident it was a cargo exhaust fan that failed and disconnected itself. Actions -We first donned our oxygen masks; confirmed Oxygen on 100% and my First Officer (FO) immediately got the smoke/ fumes QRH out and started to accomplish the checklist items. We were in Moderate turbulence; and IMC at this time; autopilot/autoflight systems on. Turbulence was causing altitude deviations of +/- 100 feet. Previous to this; since we were in IMC; we checked the OAT which was -36C so we turned on engine and wing anti-ice. We did not fly over or near any radar returns of yellow or red.  Several calls from the flight attendants (FA) indicated the presence of substantial electrical odor in the cabin; and it was significant. Passenger Flight attendant call buttons were going off in large quantity. We immediately were thinking about a return to the departure airport. Substantial thunderstorm activity was along our route and we were immediately thinking how to break track if this didn't improve immediately. Moments later; we lost our Mach Airspeed indicators; which spun down; our speed tapes dropped to minimum speed; and the auto throttles advanced along with an immediate stick shaker. We also received several yellow EICAS warnings however I was immediately task focused on flying the airplane. The Air France 447 situation (loss of all airspeed indications). And the Swissair 111 situation (Inflight electrical fire) immediately came to mind. I disconnected the auto throttles; autopilot and hand flew the jet; referencing the standby airspeed indicator which then wound down almost instantly. We had no reliable airspeed indications and a stick shaker; in Moderate turbulence in IMC.  I added thrust; as I was fighting Moderate turbulence; and flying wings level and a relative known pitch; and with virtually no airspeed references; I resorted to an approximate known fuel flow of about 4000Lbs/engine and pitch slightly above the Horizon. (Knowing cruise would also be about 1.55 EPR and pitch 2.5-3.5).We declared an emergency on 121.5. Got a response from several aircraft; one was helpful and relayed our position and Emergency declaration to Oceanic on HF Radio. I turned right to break off of the track; and was having to navigate between thunderstorms the best I could while in IMC. Knowing that ideal would be to get to 15NM parallel track; however with all the weather; I believed other aircraft may be deviating this distance left and right of track; and 15NM Right/South of track was not possible with the weather. 25-30 miles or halfway between tracks probably would be safer in such an emergency; and with no airspeed references.  My FO was accomplishing the QRH Smoke Fumes checklist and checked with me prior to turning the left Recirc fan off; which changes many things to vent any smoke/fumes; and since we were already diverting; I nodded and said yes; do it. We flew approximately 20-30 miles off to the Right/South and set up a direct to the departure airport which the ALTN page showed as the nearest airport.  We set up FL240 in the MCP Altitude window.  I started a gentle descent; as aircraft controllability was of significant concern without reliable airspeed indications. Turbulence was still BRUTAL. Airspeed indications came back and were lost 3 different times; and I adjusted power based on what we had. Additionally I was having substantial right engine vibration of 5.0; and while I had no airspeed indications. Still in solid IMC; I was trying to differentiate between unrelenting turbulence; the stick shaker; engine vibration possibly due to ice crystal icing; and possibly airframe vibration/buffet possibly due to higher Mach speed (by feel) to which I reduced thrust gently to combat. I resorted to an approximate fuel flow and pitch as often as I could. We closed the right engine (#2) bleed; and opened the isolation valve in the event that the fumes could have been partially coming from the Right engine; since its N1 Vibration was at 5.0; which was Amber in color. This did not have an effect on the fumes on the airplane. My knowledge of the Ice Crystal Icing procedures above FL250 was to have Engine Anti Ice ON (already was on) and avoid suspected conditions (we already were trying to get out of it). We were task saturated.  Mindset - When we initially got the electrical smoke/fumes/smell during the high level of turbulence followed by the loss of all airspeed indications; since we weren't flying over any yellow or red radar echoes; had no moisture indications on the windshield; no sulfur smell; my thought immediately went to a chaffed electrical harness supplying heating to Pitot/Static and possible other systems; which may have been the source of airspeed indication failures; rather than Ice Crystal Icing causing Airspeed/Mach Indication losses; and the electrical fumes were very strong.  My FO had completed the Smoke/Fumes checklist. The Electrical burning odor was still prevalent throughout the aircraft but stable and appeared to be dissipating; so we did not choose to accomplish the Smoke removal checklist. My thoughts were to get off track far enough to avoid deviating aircraft; reverse course and descend to lower altitude both to safely get below the tracks; below the headwinds; other aircraft; and possibly out of the IMC so as to resolve any icing issue if we had a partially heated system; out of the turbulence to stop any electrical wiring chaffing and into VMC to help fly the airplane with more references; and less task saturation. After established heading back at FL240; an approximate speed of 280 knots indicated; Airspeed indications which had returned had stabilized and I was able to engage an autopilot and autoflight systems. The Engine Vibration indications (N1) were normal and not indicated in Amber. At this point we were able to talk with ATC and complete a phone patch with our company Dispatch and Maintenance folks. I explained the Fumes; the loss of Airspeed indications; the Right Engine vibration; etc. and was headed back. We contacted Approach with our position and were given FL240. They provided us a SQUAWK and cleared us direct. We reassessed the cabin situation; and I gave the passengers a PA explaining what we had; as far as the electrical smell/smoke concern and our decision to return. I did not explain the flight instrument failures or vibration issues; as this was not of concern to the passengers and would have been of no benefit to them. We eventually were provided landing data; which showed us possibly landing a couple of thousand pounds over structural landing weight but well under performance limits. My thoughts were to reassess the condition of the smoke/fumes as we got closer to the airport and determine if two slight further airports may be a better option. As we got closer; an assessment of the conditions indicated that all things were stable; no increasing smoke/fumes were being generated and while time was important; things weren't dire. The flight attendants indicated that the level of fumes would come and go but weren't increasing at this time. The weather at our destination was rapidly deteriorating; winds down the runway at close to 40Kts; as were in one of our optional airport; but the visibility at our destination was at 1 mile; mostly due to rain; which was below the Cat C landing minimums and reported to be deteriorating in rain. That was no longer suitable. The other two airports were the same in time; and with the fact that winds were high and one airport had one runway; I didn't want to get in the possible situation of some aircraft getting disabled on the runway there and us having to go to the third airport anyway; so the decision was made to go to the largest of our alternative. An uneventfullanding was made and we taxied to the gate; followed by emergency vehicles as they were examining our aircraft continually. At the gate the fireman looked for my thumbs up and he returned the same and we completed our parking checklist.","The reporter stated that the aircraft was removed from service and returned only after completion of extensive maintenance procedures during which no systems anomalies were found. The Reporter recalled the timeline and sequence of the anomalies. Because the Air Data and Standby systems have no physical connection and the respective systems failures occurred sequentially; the Reporter has not ruled out the possibility of ice accretion; which the pitot static and engine anti-ice/deice systems were incapable of coping with. The airspeed indications' return to normal occurred sometime after the air turn back and during the descent; but the Reporter does not believe the aircraft was in complete VMC conditions; just a thinning cloud cover. The most puzzling component of this event was the burning electrical odor which QRH did not describe in the Loss of Airspeed checklist.","We also received several yellow EICAS warnings however we were immediately task saturated and focused on flying the airplane. The Captain disconnected the autothrottles; autopilot and hand flew the jet. We were both referencing the standby airspeed indicator which then wound down almost instantly.

Our altimeters seemed to be accurate.I had completed the Smoke/Fumes checklist. The Electrical-burning odor was still prevalent throughout the aircraft but stable and appeared to be dissipating; so we did not chose to accomplish the Smoke removal checklist.

FAA observation and the check airmen had brought the aircraft in. We were all running late due to weather and downline operational issues. The crew that were displaced due to my checkride were deadheading in the cabin. All went well up until we had completed deicing. We received the post deice/anti ice report and were in the process of starting the engines when we received a call from the cabin. The deadheading Captain was not happy with the state of the wing surface post deice. We discussed the issue; shut down the engines and called the deice team to come and give us an inspection. They came back and told us the wings were clear and we were clear to leave. Still not happy we had the Observing Captain do an inspection from the cabin. Upon his return he informed us the upper surface at the tip ends looked as though a bucket of water had been poured and left to freeze. The type 4 fluid just did not look correct. From my position I was able to just see 1 foot or so of the right wing and understood what he was talking about.With this information we came to the conclusion a second deice/anti-ice was needed. After a great deal of discussion we were told to move to the other end of the concourse in order to allow another carrier aircraft to get to the gate and they would send the deice crew down to us. We did so and upon contact with deice man were given a lesson on how anti ice fluids work. Keeping his patience well; the Captain explained our experience level between us and that we understood the properties but for safety would like to be re-sprayed. This was done to our satisfaction and we departed with a greater delay. There is no real event here where I believe we did anything unsafe or violated any SOPs; however I wanted to be sure this event was documented to ensure it was seen by safety individuals who could use it later on. I can only commend the deadheading crewmembers for their vigilance and say how impressed I am to work with the Professional crews I have found here on my New Certificate. Considering this was my Check ride to be released into the system for revenue flying; I feel more and more confident I can put my faith in the people I am dealing with. My recommendation would be for the ground crews to be given an opportunity to see our view of things from the restriction we have and how very different the airframe appears in the lighting we have available.

The 21-1 Chart [ILS Y Rwy 17L] does not clearly depict terrain in the vicinity of PUMAR due to a holding pattern inset; although it appears that there is a low area of white on final; in fact the holding inset covers and removes all terrain depictions. The RADAR MNM ALTS chart is a little difficult to interpret in this same area; again showing all white; although there is a small  band where FL75 is the min altitude and I should have noticed that as well. The flight level 070 at PUMAR is the biggest clue; although no terrain is clearly depicted at 5000 feet in that area; I now know there is a dark ridgeline there. Although everything was briefed thoroughly; none of us had been there in many years; my copilots were low time pilots new to the company; and I hold myself fully responsible for this event. I will say that even though my mindset was that there was no terrain; my training kicked in and I immediately responded to the warning.",,"On the arrival into SCEL we flew the ANDES5.

I was doing the maintenance on a maintenance delay. Since I was on a delay I wanted to take advantage and top off the Liquid O2 (LOX). The LOX is contained in the aircraft R/H baggage hold. I removed the LOX container and took it into the hospital to service it with LOX. After the converter was full I let it set in the hospital for a while to thaw the frost that builds up during the fill process. I continued with the inspections. At some point I took the container back out to the ship and re-installed it.  The LOX has two electrical wires for quantity indication; and two flexible hoses; one for vent; and one for pressure. After I installed the full converter I checked the installation for O2 flow by turning on the O2 shutoff valve and the flow control on the O2 panel. I had O2 flow and the quantity indicated 8 liters +. I learned this morning when I returned to work that I had left the pressure hose disconnected. Because of this no O2 was available from the aircraft O2 cabinet. I was informed the flight was ok because there was back up gaseous O2 available. This was very confusing because I had O2 flow during the post installation flow check. Today I was at another base working on my normal ship. It also has LOX system. I attempted to duplicate this situation. I found that even after the LOX pressure hose is disconnected from the LOX container there is still enough residual O2 in the system that it is possible to get a flow from the O2 panel. If the flow control is not set to high flow rates it is possible to get flow for longer than one would expect. [Recommend:]1.While performing multiple tasks better planning can be done to avoid starting and stopping midway thru a task. 2.When checking flow from the O2 panel one must turn the flow control full on and run the O2 until such a time as the quantity indicator shows a decrease in quantity. The quantity display is very sensitive and will indicate even a small amount of O2 use.3.The medical crew needs to be alerted when the LOX is serviced so as to implement an additional layer of checks.","Reporter stated medical evacuation helicopters require specific Supplemental Type Certificates (STC) to install a medical cabin. A medical panel is built into the aft bulkhead of the cabin fuselage section. The panel faces forward. The LOX container is a round stainless steel sphere with a heat exchanger located in the baggage pit below the transmission deck. On the LOX sphere is a pressure transducer that is a digital readout of the LOX quantity in liters. There is no other pressure gauge required per the STC after the LOX sphere.Reporter stated the Manual OFF-ON O2 handle for the LOX system is located on the left aft side of the Captain's seat; which is the right seat position on their single pilot aircraft. The shut-off handle operates a push-pull cable to a regulator that is downstream (after) the LOX heat exchanger and before the medical O2 panel. The medical panel has four oxygen outlets. Two outlets that provide full O2 vapor pressure and two individually regulated outlets that use flow control. Medical Staff must look aft at the aft bulkhead to verify O2 is flowing; but would not be aware when looking forward if the O2 flow suddenly stopped. In the past; even pilots have unknowingly moved the Manual Off-ON O2 handle; which is near their left seat belt attachment and shutting off available O2 to the medical panel without the Medical Staff being aware of the condition; since the only pressure gauge is at the LOX sphere. Since technicians and pilots can unknowingly create an unsafe condition; he recommends the STC require adding a LOX Low pressure light to the center panel on the forward side of the medical cabin that is an additional alert to the Medical Staff that a drop in available oxygen to a patient has occurred.",,,"An Aircraft Maintenance Technician (AMT) was informed he had left a pressure hose disconnected from an LOX sphere after reinstalling the serviced oxygen sphere on an AS-350 Medical helicopter. Residual pressure in the oxygen system line was enough to show oxygen flow at the O2 panel during his O2 check. Technician recommends the Medical STC require a low pressure O2 light be added to the center panel to alert Medical Staff of sudden O2 loss.",

It did not help; so I moved the boost pump to the on position. The engine continued to get rougher in operation. I then advised ATC that we had an engine problem and needed the closest airport available. At this time; I feathered the engine. ATC advised that K39 (St Claire) or UUV (Sullivan) was the closest. I asked for K39 and considered UUV because it had a better and longer runway plus I thought K39 was closed. I started to ask for UUV when ATC indicated UUV was 8 miles away. At about the same time; ATC also indicated we were over K39 so I decided to stay with the original plan and land at K39.

Flying a friend in the Stearman. This was the 6th landing of the 2nd flight; and the 11th landing of the day. On the 5th landing of this flight; noticed a sudden quick pull to the right on the start of the roll-out after touchdown with the tail-wheel in full contact. Did a go around before the aircraft could depart control. I decided to do a wheel landing to be safe and carry power on the next landing for better control. Touched down lightly on the mains just right of center line. Rolled the power back and stick full aft to bring the tail-wheel into contact with the ground and began a long roll-out. At just below 40 mph; stick full aft and power off; the airplane lurched to the right briefly; I corrected with left rudder; then right as I still had my heels on the ground; the aircraft started a soft turn to the left and would not correct back right with rudder. I pressed brakes on the right to correct and the right wing dipped; I brought power in to straighten the nose and immediately to idle when the wing tip cleared the ground and applied brakes evenly to slow the aircraft as we departed 90 degrees to the runway. At a slow roll the aircraft main wheels slid into a small muddy drainage ditch at the side of the runway and the airplane rolled slowly up to its nose to rest on the lower portion of the engine. During that time I brought the mixture to cut off and turned the mags off as we settled nose first; tail high into the mud. After pulling the aircraft from the ditch with the help of local airport personnel; we were able to clean out the mud; inspect the structure and engine; pull the prop through; start the engine and taxi the aircraft back to the hangar for further inspection. There was no apparent damage to the airport; the airplane or anyone on board the aircraft. This is a very old aircraft; flown regularly; We suspect once of many possible causes for the initial pull to the right and found evidence on the runway where the right wheel had locked on the roll-out. We suspect that the brake drum may be slightly out of round or the well worn tires caused unusual heating of the bearings; causing one to lock after the roll-out; other possible cause we will be researching is the brake cabling in conjunction with the rudder movement; the tail-wheel alignment and cabling tolerances and the brake shoes and master cylinders themselves. We have grounded the airplane until all possibilities can be researched inspected and either fixed or ruled out. As for the runway departure; the initial locking of the brake caused me as the pilot to react quickly on the left rudder to compensate for the sudden right turn; then back hard on the right and due to the relatively slow speed putting the aircraft under the rudder authority speed caused a side loading on the right wheel and dragging of right wingtip; once turned more than about 30 degrees at such a speed there was no longer the possibility to control the aircraft's' direction and I got to go along for the ride until wing came off the pavement. Final thoughts; if the muddy ditch had been another 10 to 20 yards from the runway; I definitely would have been able to stop the aircraft before rolling into it; A full stall landing would not have helped due to the nature of the initial wheel locking at a speed below rudder authority speed; My reaction to the wheel lock may have been appropriate had the wheel stayed locked; but when the right wheel unloaded the weight on it; it began rolling again; causing a partial ground loop and an uncontrollable situation at the low speed with my toes off the brakes.",,,,"PT-13 pilot reported loss of directional control after landing; resulting in wingtip contact with the ground; a runway excursion; and the aircraft ending up on its nose in the mud.",

We notified ATC immediately and made them aware of our situation and requested time to go through our checklists. After completing the appropriate checklists; briefing the passengers and evaluating our situation we determined that it was in the best interest of safety to get the airplane on the ground as soon as possible. We determined that we needed to land at an airport with a longer runway than what ZZZ had to offer since our breaking would be severely limited.

Winds were light and variable and the sky condition was clear with 10+ miles visibility.  We were communicating on 120.2 (which is a discrete frequency for traffic in the east pattern when the airport becomes busy.  119.3 is used for traffic west of the airport).  We had performed a touch and go on runway 16L and were climbing to pattern altitude (1800 feet MSL) on the upwind leg for left traffic.  As we turned left crosswind we received a traffic alert and visually spotted a low-wing aircraft about 1.0 miles on an extended downwind for 16L.  The controller had communicated '[Aircraft type] in left crosswind will be no problem for you' to some aircraft; but we weren't sure that it was this particular aircraft.  We were climbing through 1600 feet and the aircraft on TCAS was showing the pattern altitude of 1800 feet MSL.  I queried the controller about the aircraft now directly behind us at the same altitude and extremely close and there was silence.  Then the controller asked us if the aircraft was ahead of or behind us.  I said it was behind us.  He then made contact with the other aircraft and advised them of an aircraft (us) ahead and to his left.  The other aircraft said 'They are ahead and to my right and in sight.'  After we had landed; a few touch and go's later; I called the tower and spoke with a controller.  He stated that he was unaware of the situation (it had only happened 30 minutes prior) but would investigate.  He said that they were 'slammed busy' on the day and wouldn't be surprised if they had 300 IFR departures that day.  I said I appreciate a heavy workload; but it was obvious to us that the controller had lost track of us in that he had to ask us to identify which aircraft we were on the downwind.  He then stated that the other aircraft could have been a late handover from Burbank (it appeared unlikely as it appeared that the aircraft had made a direct downwind entry over the 405 from the Sepulveda Pass) or had contacted the tower late (this would be very late as they would have been miles into Class D inside the 405/101 interchange).  The controller further stated that this area is a regular 'problem' for the controllers.  This bit of anecdotal evidence was underscored by another instructor at the school where we originated the flight said the same thing had happened to her a month or so back.  I asked the controller if there was something we could have done to have prevented this.  His answer was 'No.'  Apparently there is a safety issue here and it should be addressed in some way.  I'm not sure of how the controllers track aircraft in the traffic pattern; but I believe it is with simple pen and paper.  Perhaps something a bit more exact/discrete like a transponder code?  I don't have the answer here.",,,,"Pilot reports of a busy day in the VFR traffic pattern at VNY airport.

I requested an IFR clearance and received a squawk and clearance from [Approach] with instructions to climb to 4;000 feet and expect vectors to ZZZ ILS.Upon penetrating the cloud base we began to immediately pick up ice on all leading edge surfaces (mixed rime and clear) including front wind shield to the extent that within minutes we had absolutely no visibility through the front wind shield. At 4;000 feet we made an attempt to fly vectors to the approach; however; we quickly determined that wasn't going to happen. Ice buildup was just happening way to fast and we couldn't see out the windshield.We notified Approach that we were abandoning the approach and immediately turned around and headed back in the direction we came from towards ZZZ1. We were told to maintain 3;000 feet and cleared to ZZZ1. We attempted to maintain altitude; but could not because we were still in the clouds and we continued to pick up ice. Without request from Approach I descended under the ceiling to 2;500 feet and proceeded to ZZZ1 where after about 9 or 10 visual approaches (roughly an hour) we were able to shed ice on the windshield to make a normal landing. It was a learning experience I really do not want to repeat. ZZZ1 approach and tower were extremely patient and helpful with us essentially giving us carte blanche use of the airport. We finally landed on runway 14 which was a 9;000 feet long runway I had chosen in the event we could not shed ice before running out of fuel. I could see the runway out my side window as we passed over it; I just could not see the runway out of my frosted up windshield. The length of the runway would have given me enough time to attempt a blind (out the side window) landing in the event it became inevitable. What would I have done different? Probably turned around sooner. The problem is; the ice came on so fast and thick we really didn't even recognize it until it was almost too late. Just writing this gives me the shakes. I can't remember a time I was this close to death.The funny thing is; I probably could have requested a contact approach; received it; stayed out of the clouds and landed non-eventfully at ZZZ. Again; a real learning experience I do not want to repeat.",,,,"Aerostar 600A pilot reported encountering severe icing conditions after takeoff from a Midwestern airport.",

When conflict alert activated I amended Aircraft Y's altitude to FL240 and the pilot said they were just passing through it.

They were 4.14 miles and zero feet before achieving lateral divergence. I accept full responsibility for this error. Primary contributing factors were data block congestion and a close in scan failure. In total there were six aircraft within 12 miles of ZZZ. I just missed one.Conflict alert parameters could be increased to account for aircraft performance possibilities. These aircraft were two thousand feet apart and diverging in two minutes.

I cannot keep up with working along someone with these practices. No one can; or should. In this case I wasn't able to keep up with this disregard for safety!

My workload was low; but the workload of the other controllers was much greater. As I was working my position; the Airport Service Detection Equipment (ASDE) alerted 'Warning..........runway 28R occupied.' After I heard warning; I quickly scanned my runway and then scanned the ASDE before the runway 28R occupied came through the speaker. As the location was apparent I noticed the blinking circles on the ASDE on 28R.  I then thought to myself 'It must be a false target;' but I did notice that a tagged aircraft and symbol for an aircraft was crossing runway 28R at taxiway Foxtrot. We routinely receive false/nuisance alerts usually involving runway 32L and taxiiing aircraft or false targets.  After realizing I didnt have any conflicts I spun around to look out the window.  It was then that I saw a Aircraft Y pointing northeast on the runway as an aircraft was departing (Aircraft X). As I noticed this Aircraft X passed Aircraft Y on the runway.  There was very little time between the alert and seeing the aircraft pass each other. It also appeared that there was very little distance between the two aircraft and I was very shook up as I have no idea how they avoided each other.I have never in my XX years of ATC been that terrified. I was not involved with either of the aircraft on my frequency. I just witnessed the runway incursion. I will say that there was little to say or offer for assistance as the event happened so fast and at the point we all realized what was happeneing; the time just wasnt there. The distance between EE and F on runway 28R is approx 1;900 feet. ASDE alerted in between N4/N5 and the departure aircraft seemed to be going very fast when I saw it out the window.At this point I'm not sure how the aircraft got on the runway. I was not directly involved with either aircraft. There are a few things that need to be highlighted in this event. 1) The constant false/nuisance alerts on runway 32L invlovling taxiing aircraft can lead to complacency with the alerts. 2) The ASDE leads not with where the aircraft are but 'Warning.'  Valuable time is spent letting us know a situation exists but wastes time we could use to avert a situtaion if it led with the location; especially when you have more than one runway in your jurisdiction.",,"ORD tower controllers report of a runway incursion they observed.",

I quick looked the DTW arrivals and brought up Aircraft X's data block. The aircraft was in sector 84's airspace (McCook) with .79+ in the 4th line. Direct RANDL from that location would transit LOGAN (34) and FWA (36) before entering OLK; where we would hand off to ZOB.  This course enters ZOB basically eastbound; 25 miles north of FWA and almost perpendicular to our normal DTW arrivals onthe MIZAR arrival.  There was another DTW arrival; another air carrier; immediately below Aircraft X. The other air carrier remained on the proper route to DTW; via LFD. MIZAR3.  Direct RANDL did not allow for the proper spacing behind (or infront for that matter; but that comes later) our other DTW arrivals; so LOGAN and FWA were required to vector Aircraft X into the face of the WATSN.WATSN2.ORD arrivals. And since TMU hadn't planned Aircraft X to be blended with the FWA.MIZAR stream; there was no hole for Aircraft X; which resulted in excessive vectoring to subsequent DTW arrivals.I have no idea 'Why' it happened. I have no idea what made a controller in our Southwest area think direct RANDL was a good idea.  I have no idea why the controller at McCook didn't put this aircraft over LFD or work with Joliet sector (JOT had the other carrier which was direct LFD.MIZAR3) to sequence 2 aircraft as opposed to taking Aircraft X out of the stream he was designed to fit in; and transitioning him to a stream he didn't.  I have no idea why two previous areas shirked their responsibility and shat on another area.  I'd prefer they didn't.I think Traffic Management Unit (TMU) should have been more aggressive in instructing previous controllers to route Aircraft X back over LFD.

Maintenance advised me that they would send the mechanics out to help look.

I asked the ground crew if it was okay to start engine #2 and they confirmed we were good to start and the aircraft was chocked and hooked up to the tug; but then they walked away. I went outside to make sure #2 was clear and the First Officer (FO) started the engine. While outside I looked around to see if I could see the pin. The mechanics showed up and starting looking for the pin to the door. After a while of looking we could not find the pin and the mechanics disappeared without talking to the crew. I called dispatch to see what was going on and to see if there was any spare pins; or planes we could take. That's when dispatch advised me that we would probably be swapping planes.

After the last passenger gets off I go to the back of the aircraft to advise the flight attendants what was going on. At that point in time the flight attendants advised me of a possible duty issue for them. A few minutes later the FO came back to tell us that operations had called and we are switching aircraft.

We advised the rampers of our decision and once the Captain made sure the area was cleared and the beacon was on; we started the #2 engine. Once finished loading the rampers couldn't find the handrail's door pin; due to its loss and cold windy temperatures it was decided to deplane for the sake of our passengers.

I went to the middle section of the plane around the exit row to advise the captain and flight attendants of the change. Maintenance came on the plane and advised the captain that the #2 engine was still running and he ran up and turned it off. The airplane was never unsupervised as the entire flight crew was on board the plane but I can see how not being seated at the flight deck the entire time could possibly lead to problems even with no passengers.

After STYLE and before VOGLR; the controller told us to 'Fly the VOGLR Transition'. With very little time; the Captain and First Officer reviewed the arrival again and could find no transition on the arrival. We both agreed that the arrival instructed us to depart CENAK on a heading of 270 or assigned; and expect radar vectors to final approach course. We flew the remainder of the arrival as published; and from CENAK; we turned to 270 degree heading. The Controller then asked us if we had 'missed the turn'; and instructed us to fly heading 250 and intercept the final approach course for Runway 27L. We complied and intercepted the 27L final approach course. VOGLR is listed as an IAF for the ILS 27L approach; and I believe the controller wanted us to depart VOGLR and fly course 281 to NRMAH and intercept the final approach course; even though we were not cleared for the approach when the event occurred. The WATSN2 Arrival instructs crews to fly from VOGLR to CENAK; then turn to heading 270; however; the ILS 27L approach can begin at VOGLR. The crew was confused as to what exactly the controller wanted. The crew should have queried the controller and verified exactly what he expected us to do. Next; the WATSN2 Arrival should have transitions listed if ATC expects crews to fly 'transitions' off of the arrival.

In doing so our hydraulic system # 3 read 40% on the quantity which was below the limitations for the system. I called Dispatch and asked to speak with Maintenance Control. I informed the Maintenance Controller of the problem and told him that the outside temperature was -23 degrees. He had us trouble shoot the system with no positive result. I wrote up system #3 for low fluid quantity and waited for contract maintenance to show up. In the mean time we had the Operations (OPS) frequency up and was listening. I have been flying for 15 years now and what I heard on the OPS Freq. what so unsafe.  Aircraft X taxied out to the de-ice pad. The Captain of flight; yelled over the frequency; 'HEY; THE TOP OF THE DE-ICE TRUCK IS ON FIRE'!!!I too also witnessed the truck catching fire. The whole top of the truck what engulfed in flames from the burner. After hearing what the Captain of Aircraft X said; the people operating the de-ice truck shut it off. The Captain then asked over the frequency to the de-ice crew; 'is that normal?' The response from the one of the people from the de-ice truck was; 'Technically no'I found this a blatant disregard for SAFETY. The Captain of Aircraft X then informed them that he did not want that truck next to his aircraft. I immediately told them over the frequency that; 'Aircraft Y will not be de-iced by the truck that just caught on fire. The Aircraft X flight returned to the gate. In the mean time I was in concert by phone and via ACARS to our Dispatch Supervisors and our Dispatcher. I informed them all what was happening with de-ice truck and the unsafe operations we witnessed. I also told them that in the interest of safety I would not allow our aircraft to be de-iced by that truck in question. Everyone agreed that it was unsafe and not to use the truck.  So after some time of trying to get a hold of someone of the OPS frequency I requested to have the Ramp Supervisor to come to our aircraft. The Ramp Supervisor; came on the flight deck. I asked her if this was normal operations for the de-ice truck to catch fire? What I heard next appalled me. Her reply was 'No it was not a normal operation' I then asked her since you just said that it was not normal and not safe why did you knowing continue to try and de-ice aircraft? Her reply was; 'it was not safe and she was sorry'At that point the operation of safety was not paramount nor was it was considered by all of the people involved with the de-icing of aircraft. I informed her that we will not use that truck and if you could get the other de-ice truck running we would use it. She left the flight deck and we did not hear anything for some time. While we were waiting I called my Assistant Chief Pilot and informed him via a voice mail what had transpired and how unsafe the ramp was conducting operations. While we were waiting; the Assistant Chief Pilot called me and I told him what was going on. He said you are doing the right thing by not having that truck de-ice our jet. He also informed me that he informed Aircraft Y's Safety Department of incident. Meanwhile after what had transpired the ZZZ operations continued to de-ice Express Jet and Delta Express with the same truck that caught fire.I saw the Captain of Aircraft X walking across the ramp so I approached him and introduced myself. I told him that I would be filling an ASAP; and irregular reports with my company. He also said he would do the same. Captain also informed me that the truck caught fire 3 more times bringing it to a total of 5 times it caught fire. At this point I had no confidence in anyone from the ZZZ operations to conduct a safe operation. Finally after close to 4 hours the operations informed me that they were going to get the FBO de-ice truck to deice us and that it would be supervised by their certified employee.  Before we loaded the passenger on the aircraft my passengers my flight attendants and I went inside. After we went back through TSA security we went to the gate to get let back out to the jet. As I was approaching the counter I heard two passengers on their phones saying the reason why they were so late was because the Captain and the Dispatcher were having a dispute on the deicing procedures. I could not believe what I was hearing. The gate was lying to the passenger about our situation. As we approached the gate the agent addressed me with an unprofessional attitude by asking me what the heck is going on here. I replied; would you like to discuss this in front of the passengers here or we could step outside. We went outside and I informed him of my grave concerns of the unsafe operations that the station were conducting. I replied; 'Would you like me to finish what I have to say?' His reply was 'No' and walked away. My flight attendant witnessed this unprofessional demeanor. We returned to the jet and waited for the FBO deice truck. Once we were informed that the de-ice truck was available we instructed OPS to board the passengers.After the passengers were all boarded on the jet I went into the cabin and picked up the PA and apologized for the lengthy delay today. I also thought it was important to inform the passenger the REAL reason why we were delayed today and informed them of the de-ice truck catching fire and that we take safety very serious and that I would not let them de-ice our jet and put everyone's lives in danger. We taxied to the de-ice pad and were de-iced with type I and had a tactile check done and depart without incident. In addition to the unsafe operations we dealt with today the Final Flight Attendant Report indicated that the reason why we were delayed was due to field conditions at origination. This was not the truth at all. In closing I would like to say I appreciated the professionalism and CRM from my crew First Officer and all of the outside sources from Dispatch; and the Assistant Chief Pilots. This CRM situation we had to deal with broke the bad link in the chain and stood our ground in the interest of safety because it was the right thing to do. I hope that this report will help make just and swift changes to the unsafe operation in ZZZ. FAA should audit the ZZZ station of their de-icing procedures the whole station would be retrained in the safe operation of de-icing procedures.",,,,"CRJ-200 Captain reported that while waiting for de-ice service he noticed a fire on the roof of the de-ice truck in the area of the truck's heater.",

Shortly after; he cleared us to cross the IAF 100feet above the charted altitude at that point and cleared us for the approach. I informed the controller that we would be descending in the published holding pattern at the IAF to facilitate the gradual descent for unpressurized flight. The controller did not respond. I made the same transmission when we arrived at the IAF and the controller said 'approved as requested.' We made one turn in the holding pattern before reaching the published altitude +100 Feet. We then proceeded inbound. The controller reached out to us to switch us to advisory frequency. We made our initial CTAF transmission on a 5 mile final. Airport operations informed us there were men and equipment on the runway. I responded that we were on a 3 mile final and asked if they could clear the runway. We mentally prepared for a go around at this point. Just before we reached the LNAV/VNAV DH; airport operations transmitted that all men and equipment were clear of the runway. We completed an uneventful landing. As we exited the runway; I transmitted on CTAF that we were clear of the runway. Airport operations transmitted to us to ask Center 'had advised us of the 15 minute Prior Permission Request (PPR).' We told him that we had not been advised. He responded that they had a NOTAM in effect. We did not respond. We did; however check the automated weather broadcast again. The NOTAM was not mentioned.

The Pilot Flying (PF) observed traffic on the TCAS that was approaching from about 10 o'clock position. The PF started the search for the traffic and alerted the Pilot Not Flying (PNF) the traffic was not in sight. The traffic got closer and a TA was received. PF continued to look for the traffic and without locating it the RA was received to descend. The PF initiated a descent and slight turn to the right to avoid the traffic.  As the RA was received SoCal alerted us we had traffic and to turn left. This would have put us in direct conflict with the traffic. The resolution commenced and the 'clear of conflict' was received. The RA resulted in about a 1;000-1;200 foot descent. The PNF made a radio call to SoCal to alert them of our RA. SoCal gave us a climb to 5;000 Feet and a turn left to a heading 330. The instructions seemed to be in direct conflict with 2 other targets. One at our approximate 12 o'clock and about 700 feet above us. The other at our 10 o'clock and approximately 600 feet above us. Both targets appeared to be within about 3 miles of our position.  The PF asked the PNF to query SoCal the instructions again. The PF stayed at 4;000 feet and started a shallow banked turn to the left. SoCal was busy and it was hard to get a word in. PNF asked twice for SoCal to repeat the heading. Finally the instructions were given again to expedite our climb to 5;000 and turn left to heading of 330. While in the climbing turn we received another TA from the traffic at our 10 O'clock position. The TCAS showed it 300 feet above us and slightly off our left wing. The PF looked out and saw an aircraft pass to our left and slightly behind us approximately 300-400 feet away from our aircraft; to our recollection. Neither of the 2 possible targets were ever pointed out to us. We were handed off to another controller where the PNF reminded that controller that we were climbing back to 5;000 Ft. / on a heading due to an RA. We were radar vectored onto the ILS for 16R at VNY.

Due to the high utilization of the Cessna 150 involved; the sole pilot and owner sought relief from the 100 hour inspection requirement. Approved AMOC L115W-11-986 extends the sub-annual inspection interval to 220 hours for aircraft not involved in for-hire or flight instruction ops (such as this aircraft). The individual owner and operator of the Cessna 150 sought to apply this AMOC (originally from the Cessna Aircraft Company).AD2011-10-09 includes the statement 'Before using any approved AMOC; notify your appropriate principal inspector; or lacking a principal inspector; the manager of the local flight standards district office/certificate holding district office.' As directed in the AD; and following a phone call with the local FSDO stating his intent; the owner then proceeded to fax a letter to the manager of the aircraft's FSDO stating his application of the AMOC to the airframe involved. Having notified the FSDO of his application of the approved AMOC; the owner then proceeded to operate the aircraft beyond 100 hours between seat rail inspections (but less than 220 hours). A subsequent phone call with the FSDO approximately 10 months later revealed that the owner or responsible Maintenance Technician should have received a letter approving the application of the AMOC from the FSDO before the aircraft changes its maintenance schedule. The aircraft had just had the necessary inspections detailed in the AD performed. As a corrective action going forward; the owner will comply with the AD as written (inspect every 100 hours) unless a letter specifically authorizing an alternative compliance is in hand.A contributing factor to this oversight was a lack of clear requirements for AMOC application in either the AD or the approved AMOC itself. AD's state that operators must notify the appropriate FSDO; but do not state that an official letter or paperwork must be received and on-hand prior to transferring/applying an already approved AMOC.",,,,"A pilot owner-operator reported that he had advised the FAA Flight Standard District Office of the desire to apply an Alternate Means of Compliance for an Airworthiness Directive.

The planned diversion was to be to ZZZ1. NOTAMs were checked at both airports. ZZZ had no report for anything regarding snow-which was expected due to having this occurrence with a student before. However; I thought that ZZZ1 would have a NOTAM regarding snow condition or if the runway was unusable or closed due to the snow accumulation. No NOTAM was seen regarding that. At ZZZ diversion was initiated as planned. Upon coming to ZZZ1; we noticed that it looked like the airport was mostly still covered in snow. Upon flyover; we noticed that there was a thin plowed section on the runway centerline maybe 20 ft or less in width. I decided we would enter the pattern and fly the approach and decide whether to land or not. Landing was executed upon seeing runway centerline. I as the instructor should have been doing the full landing and on the controls. However; I let the student attempt to initiate the landing. We ended up getting out of the plowed portion and upon side pull; I took the flight controls. I put in lots of left rudder due to the unplowed portion pulling us to the right. We then fishtailed to the left and upon that right rudder was put in. Speed at this point had been reduced quite a bit and a stop was made just to the left of runway centerline. I then did a soft field takeoff remaining in the plowed portion. On review; I as the instructor should have been on the controls the full time during landing. 2nd lesson was that we should have just abandoned the landing due to the unplowed portion and the risk of side pull or ground control loss. 3rd lesson was to not expect an uncontrolled field to put out a NOTAM if the airport has snow on the runway or if the runway is unusable.

The controller should have done one a few items:1) Kept us on his frequency; given us the traffic advisory until the aircraft was well clear; then cleared us for the visual; OR2) Kept us on the 160 heading and coordinated with the tower controller on the traffic before clearing us for the visual;OR3) Advised us of the conflicting traffic and given us the choice to turn on not until we picked up the traffic and used visual separation to remain safe;OR4) Given us a climb back into Class B airspace (@ 4000 msl) to ensure safe separation.This particular location where the problem occurred was below Class B shelf and outside ZZZ Delta airspace; i.e no-man's land with us being put in a vulnerable position.This is a recurring problem in this airspace and this is the 3rd time (in 3 months) we have been put in a conflicting position requiring RA maneuvers to avoid traffic.

ZAB pushes the GIMS [Ground Based Interval Management-Spacing] numbers to the glass so they get a good delivery internally at ZAB.  ZAB refuses to push the numbers to the glass of the ZAB controllers that feed P50.  This results in a poor deliver of aircraft and an ongoing problem whereby they constantly over deliver day in and day out during the same time frames.ZAB also refuses to use the alternate route (deconflicted) regularly for turbo props.   Many times they just stack them underneath the jets while they are over delivering.TBFM may not be configured correctly.  However; it is hard to prove if they will not push to the glass.

If set correctly; you should set your stream along with other parameters and then meet the times on the glass.ZAB needs a procedural change whereby they push the numbers to the glass all the time. NATCA and management from each facility should meet to ensure that TBFM is set up correctly with what P50 needs.",,,,"P50 Controller reports of ZAB over delivering aircraft and questions if TBFM [Time Based Flow Management] tool is set correctly.",

Roughly 10-20 min later the Pilot calls pressing for more ATOG. I felt pressured into creating a plan to increase ATOG and even told the captain; 'I don't want to put my name on this plan' and mentioned not liking being forced to pencil whip a plan.The long version:20 prior to dept ops agent calls; 1300lbs over atog. I ask if fuel is on plane; and learn it is. I tell them 'nothing I can do- I can maybe get them 200lbs as the stage length is too short.'At departure time Captain (CA) calls; says we need more weight. I say; (thinking no way he will go for it;) 'the only way we can get more weight is to drop the planned altitude by maybe ten thousand feet.'  He says do it. I reluctantly plan it; tell him it only gives us 500lbs more weight-they still have 800lbs too much.After some digging I see the preplan from this ops agent is 2000lbs below ATOG.  My plan on the release is 900lbs below ATOG. (my ATOG was 132.2 and his preplan was 130.something)... I'm at a loss; don't understand why all of the sudden we are 1300lbs OVER atog.  We decide to change the alternate; plan to fly lower and remove 1300lbs of fuel from the airplane to accommodate all passengers.   Ops calls for the fueler; they arrive without a truck.Next we are told de-fuel will take 90 minutes due to shift change for them. (Time pressures/threats) I tell the agent that IF had he called me 1 hr before departure I could have helped and he has put me into a corner. I ask where did this weight come from-he says it is standby passengers.  I ask; revenue or non-revenue? He says non-revenue.Then the captain gets back on and says 'so I guess I have to be the bad guy and kick passengers off' (passive aggressive pressure applied to the dispatcher; making the dispatcher feel like the real 'bad guy'). So I said yes; 800lbs worth.  I remind him as well; had the ops agent called me BEFORE we fueled the airplane I could have helped out.  At some point I was informed the fuelers loaded 15.4 on the plane; and I had asked for 15.0.Main factor/threat:  I was pressured by the captain who was probably just trying to be the good guy-but these scenarios should not even be happening.  When I come up with a plan BELOW ATOG and the ops agent calls me AFTER the aircraft is fueled; telling me that they are ABOVE atog-not much I can do for them.Secondary  factor: I had 10 flights scheduled to push at that airport within 40 minutes--and a flurry of phone calls from ops agents; pilots ; AND chasing weather forecasts to make sure alternates were legal made for a very busy time frame.   One flight monopolizing all my time set me up to just want to get them taken care of and off the gate.  This one flight took up 15 minutes of my time.Another factor:  I noticed reposition flight appear on my desk a few minutes before I got the call weight issue.  The SOD who built the flight did not contact me to tell me it was coming; or tell me it was placed into my workload. I immediately called the chief dispatcher and said NO-I can NOT accept another flight during this departure bank.  The distraction of an added position flight during a very busy departure bank contributed to the over saturation of workload.  The subsequent phone calls for that position ferry also created additional workload-even after the flight was reassigned to a neighboring desk.The preplan by all agents should include standby passengers; this particular agent may need more guidance/supervision (I don't think his preplan included non revenue passengers and may have set this scenario up).  Pilots should NOT be expected to ask to get all possible passengers on the airplane; or should not be put in the position to have to take passengers off the plane.  The Ops agent started the boardingprocess knowing he was going to have a weight issue; and put us in an uncomfortable position of removing passengers.  We are in the business of moving people safely; and nothing about this plan was unsafe per se; but the fact that the captain and ops agent lobbied so hard to get non revenue passengers/standby passengers on this flight can be the start of the classic slippery slope. ATOG should not be negotiable when it is a landing limit.  Pilots and Ops Agents should not even ASK. I was pressured into a plan to accommodate passengers; and then find out it was for standby passengers.  Due to the workload on my desk at the time my reaction after saying 'NO' 2 times was to do whatever it took to get off the phone and get the flight off the gate.  Desk workload needs to be assessed.  If the weather was VFR this may not have been an issue.  However; all flights required alternates; this airport was set up for deicing delays; 10 flights pushing there within 40 minutes of each other is not a reasonable workload for one dispatcher.  10 flights pushing from different departure cities may be a more plausible scenario. However; when you put 10 planes; 20 pilots; 10 ops agents on one desk if *ANYthing* abnormal occurs ...well you get the idea.",,,,"A B737 Captain and Agent attempted to force an overloaded Dispatcher into increasing the Allowable Takeoff Weight to accommodated non revenue passengers.",

He mentioned that there was an existing MEL write up on our aircraft. This read; 'Left intermediate press. sensor inop. (Bleed Press Sensor L).' He said that the flight crew that had brought the aircraft had had a rather lengthy conference call on their flight with [Dispatch] and [Maintenance Control] about this write up. My dispatcher indicated (and I concur) that there was nothing for the flight crew to do about this write up; no switches to re-configure and no legal or practical limitations on the operation. Once in our own aircraft doing preflight and cockpit set up duties; we did not see any STATUS messages connected with this MEL. So we sent an ACARS inquiry to [Maintenance Control]. Was the system's ability to generate a status message disabled or locked out by maintenance action in concert with the MEL? Unfortunately; we never received a response back and I did not follow up.We then took off and climbed normally. Then early in cruise; at 32;000 ft after the relief crew had left the cockpit for their rest break; the first officer (FO) and I got an EICAS caution message 'BLEED OFF ENG L.' We read the checklist guidance which basically said 'The engine bleed valve is closed because of a system fault.' We also broke out the flight manual and looked at pneumatic schematic along with pulling up the aircraft 'AIR' synoptic. All the aircraft pneumatic system isolation valves had opened up properly and all systems were being supplied. Next; we SATCOMed [Dispatch] and got a patch with [Maintenance Control]. Our question was whether the EICAS' BLEED OFF ENG L' was at all related to the previously mentioned MEL. We were assured that it was not; that the two anomalies were to be considered separate in that the MEL problem did not cause the EICAS. We also discussed the fact that we still had engine anti-ice available for the L engine as well as a full up wing anti-ice system for both wings. We felt OK with our situation; [Maintenance Control] had nothing more to add and neither did [Dispatch]. When the relief crew took over the cockpit; I had failed to brief them on the EICAS 'BLEED OFF ENG L' that we had dealt with four hours previously. Therefore; they soon launched their own subsequent inquiry when we were over the Atlantic (ETOPS airspace) and were rightly concerned that we were operating with only one air source (the R engine bleed) to supply our pneumatic needs. A loss of that one source would have necessitated an eventual descent to 22;000 to be able to draw APU supplied pneumatic air. Not a great thought. Granted; this EICAS 'BLEED OFF ENG L' occurred after takeoff (after the point of dispatch). No violation; but in retrospect; how good an idea was this operation? I cannot think of a FAR that we violated but it seems that safety was eroded. In this day and age when we want to operate every flight successfully; I believe that it is important to self-reflect and ask 'Did I contribute to a 'Morton Thiokol' mentality where 'By golly; we are going to complete the mission; here boys!' We don't want that mindset to pervade our cockpits to where we develop a culture of 'mission completion' at all costs. Perhaps I succumbed to this mentality myself briefly. Yet; we all know as well that if we want a risk free world; we need to all stay in bed all day curled up in the fetal position. In that kind of world; airplanes do not fly and airlines do not exist. Measure; reasoned risk allows us to operate and make money (since we are not a utility). Yet; due to [a] recent aircraft fire; the very aircraft that we flew was being taken out of a planned 24 hr. service visit to be sent back out. At some point; we may have a situation where we end up fixing that aircraft in a different location as opposed to our own hangar. I'm sure decision makers in those cases; compared to the rest of us; have way more brain power and are making far more money.  I rest my case.",,,,"A flight crew experienced an EICAS message 'BLEED OFF ENG X' early in cruise.

One mechanic asked me if we had written up the vibration felt in the floor at seat 6AB. I informed him that we were just informed by the flight attendant and had not had a chance to put it into ACARS. He then told me that they did not know what was causing the vibration and 'not to write it up and we could take the aircraft.' He said that if we write it up it would delay the departure and cause them to have to open up panels. I informed him that FARs require us to write up discrepancies; I wanted it to be written up so that it would be documented and what they had done to identify and remedy the discrepancy recorded. Since we were about to go over the Pacific; into ETOPS airspace; I felt it was prudent to identify the problem.This was a clear violation of FAR and totally unprofessional with no regard for aircraft safety. This is not a unique occurrence and becoming more of the norm in maintenance operations on a daily basis; As it turned out; it was an impending equipment failure in the fire/smoke detection system.",,"Upon arrival at the aircraft we could hear a hum and feel a vibration near seats 6AB.

I reminded him that [company] policy and the FAR's both require us to document any discrepancies.We entered the discrepancy in ACARS and contacted maintenance via radio. The vibration turned out to be an impending failure of a fan in the forward cargo compartment smoke detection system.

Upon first contact with NORCAL TRACON; we were assigned the LDA PRM to 28R. We scrambled to brief the 2 page approach which had many steps that were not part of our normal SOP. NORCAL cleared us to follow course only and assigned us 210 knots. NORCAL kept stepping us down to next lower altitude right at FATUS; HEGOT; WASOP; respectively instead of clearing us for the approach. Once inside of WASOP (13 DME) NORCAL finally slowed us to 180kts and then cleared us for the approach. We dropped the gear and slowed but we couldn't get to 3000 ft by MIUKE. With parallel traffic less than 2 miles on TCAS display; NORCAL slowed us to 160 kts. By this point we went IMC and needed 2000 fpm descent from 3000 to 1800 feet but we still had not reached assigned speed of 160 kts. I elected to execute a go around because of our un-stabilized condition and descent into IMC with traffic too close. When executing our go around I called for flap 3 (which they were already there) and then called for gear up. I watched the Captain put his hand on the gear handle and had processed that he heard my call. At the same time NORCAL instructed us to fly runway heading 280 vice the hard right turnout to 030. I had already started my right turn; so the change in course (toward the parallel traffic) I believe distracted the captain from actually raising the gear and then I became fixated on traffic separation; course correction; and not over-speeding the flaps. After reaching 4000 we discussed that it sounded like the gear doors were still open but nothing on the wheels page seemed unusual. We continued to fly around the bay unknowingly with the gear down at 210 kts and scrambling to brief the ILS PRM RWY 28L (another 2 page brief). Once we turned final I realized that the gear was still down. We continued this approach without any other errors. I believe the close proximity of the parallel traffic; unannounced LDA PRM assignment; and the poor IFR speed assignments were factors contributing to our error with the gear on the go around.",,"The late slowing was aggravating the need to descend as we continued to be high and fast to the point of finally requiring a go around prior to reaching the final approach fix. ATC cleared us to climb to 4000 FT and fly HDG 280. To this point; this had been an extremely busy descent; approach; and now missed approach. Per SOP; my First Officer (FO) selected TOGA thrust; called for the flaps; gear; and missed approach altitude. I clearly remember doing each. After leveling at 4000 FT; I completed the After Takeoff Checklist. Afterward; My FO said that he was hearing an air noise that sounded like the nose gear door was not fully closed. Certain that the gear was up since I had raised it and he saw me raise it; we both checked the WHEEL page and verified that the gear doors were all closed. During this time; we had been vectored for a left downwind for the ILS PRM 28L. After we had turned base leg; my FO realized that the LNDG GEAR panel lights were illuminated green indicating that the gear was in fact still down. We were both dumbfounded to know that although we both saw me reach for the gear handle; I did not raise it and that we both did not see that the gear was still down while we were looking at all the gear indications investigating the air sound. Clearly this was a case of both of us seeing the gear in the position that we expected to see it despite the green down indicator lights. We realized that while I was reaching to raise the gear; ATC was also giving us altitude and heading instructions as well as asking us why we were going around which may have caused me to take my hand off the gear handle before raising it to turn the heading and altitude knobs. I then got further distracted with responding to ATC and didn't realize that I had not raised the gear at all. My FO saw me reach for the gear handle and being task saturated himself concluded that the gear was raised.The actual go around maneuver on the line is one that always requires a debriefing due to the fact that we rarely do them. This is the first time that I have ever done this and it begs the question..how? How do two pilots with our experience make this type of mistake? Although it had been a long day; fatigue was not a significant factor if at all. It was certainly a combination of the contributing factors including stresses and task saturation. I am also certain that there is a psychological response to that question which I am not qualified to make but the fact that two very experienced pilots can see the same gear down indication as gear up for at least 5 minutes is very curious. Also; I initially concluded that I should have waited to communicate with ATC while executing the go around but I did need to advise that we were going around and acknowledge the clearance. In the future I would do that after the immediate actions were completed..TOGA; FLAPS; GEAR; ALTITUDE; then call ATC. In addition; somehow I feel that this event started with us getting an unexpected complex approach from NORCAL APP Control in the descent which wasn't advertised in the most current ATIS which led to us getting behind after being comfortably ahead up to that point. With ATC's poor control of our speed and descent; we never caught up which led to our eventual go around. I should have mitigated that threat by asking for delay vectors or holding to properly brief that approach and then when I became uncomfortable with our speed and altitude; I should have ask for slower and lower. At some point; we may still have needed to go around but we would have more mentally ahead and prepared for it which would have helped me/us manage the task saturation of the go around better. It would have also improved our CRM since I was briefing the approach while my FO was busy flying. I pride my in managing threats well but in the end; I believe that poor management on my part and poor service from ATC led to this event. My very strong recommendation for ATC is that they do not assignthe PRM approach to aircraft in the descent unless it was previously advertised on the ATIS and speed and altitude management need to be more conducive to the approach profile.We landed without further incident after the second approach.",,"A flight crew was cleared for an approach different from the one they had briefed. They were able to complete the new briefing but were high and fast on final and executed a go-around. On the go-around both pilots thought the gear had been raised but it was not.

We were a little more than an hour out. We got an HF phone patch to dispatch / [Maintenance Control] and notified them of our intentions.

The residual oil was cleaned from the engine and cowl and the engine refilled with oil. We ( the crew ) preformed an idle engine run at the gate while maintenance observed the engine. It was determined that the oil was coming from the IDG drain pad tube but not the location of the actual leak. The rate was measured and [Maintenance Control] determined that it was within acceptable (at idle) parameters. They said we were good to go. My personal decision was that to me that it was not acceptable and I would not take the aircraft in that condition. A leak at idle is one thing it's an entirely different matter at high power and without a real fix I would not take that aircraft over the water (class 2 ) at night to an intended destination with poor weather. The oil quantities were looked at on the ground but it was the situation where I can't recall the actual numbers but know they were acceptable. The oil had been topped off prior to arriving but I have no idea when the leak developed and had nothing to gauge the loss against.  [Flight was cancelled].

My partner went to the cockpit to set the parking brake. He came back out to help remove the damaged tire and install the new one. When the new tire was installed he went back to the cockpit to release the parking brake. At that point the FAA inspector was approaching me while I was re-installing the axle nut. He asked to see the tire change task card; I handed it to him and continued installing the axle nut. He asked me why the gear pins were not installed. My response was 'I don't know' as I was trying to concentrate on the tire install. He informed me the gear pins were not installed and the anti-skid was not shut off. He continued to say 'you have the task card but you aren't following it'. I didn't have any response as I was still installing the tire. Technician Y returned to help torque the axle nut. After that he went to get the gear pins and he did install them. The FAA inspector walked away after that. I know I was wrong for not installing the gear pins first as indicated on the task card. I honestly was more concerned about getting the airplane ready for its flight and getting out of the elements which at the time was extremely cold with wind chills in the negatives. The FAA inspector had brought the issue to our attention while we were in the process of getting the problem corrected.In my opinion; the lack of compliance with the task card in this particular instance is directly related to the time crunch of the flight schedules as it usually is in Line maintenance; and the in climate weather that we were having yesterday. Human factors play a big part in any non-compliance issues as they certainly did in this event.

My developmental said something and that is when the Local 2 controller realized that it was his airplane that landed on our runway.In my opinion this situation should have never happened. I should have trusted my instinct to realize that something was not right and immediately visually correlated our planes out the window and on the radar. The developmental should have known through his scan that there was an additional airplane for his runway and spoke up. The Local 2 controller should have indicated at some point that he had an aircraft unaccounted for and that may have been the clue to indicate to us that we had an unauthorized plane landing our runway. I can't remember the circumstances; but a standalone CIC (who usually also works as a cab coordinator) could have helped to recognize that aircraft lining up for the wrong runway. The pilot also made a great error in not correlating the runway he was landing on to the one he was assigned.

With the gear down; and the flaps at 20 degrees; the applicant thought he was a little high; and decided to do a forward slip to lose altitude. He slipped aggressively nose left; right wing down; which immediately caught my attention. As he did this; he increased pitch; and we started losing airspeed. Before I could say anything; he corrected and reduced the pitch; still in a forward slip. A second later; around 100 feet; he aggressively increased pitch again; alarmed; I checked our airspeed and it was decreasing through 50 knots. I yelled 'go-around; go-around; go-around; my plane' and reached for the throttle. His hand was already on the throttle; blocking my hand. He advanced power; but much too little; and by then; too late. I simultaneously grabbed the yoke; to reduce pitch and prevent the stall. At the same time; [the student] reduced pitch; but without the power; we stalled about 10 feet above the ground. As the nose was coming forward; we landed on the main and nose gear. All the momentum was pitching forward at that point; collapsing the nose gear; and striking the prop on the ground. The applicant apologized to me later; saying that he was so focused and committed to landing; having tunnel vision that he wasn't going to go around; nor let me take the aircraft. As an instructor; and examiner; I recommend practicing go-arounds and proper transfer of controls on short-final with your students. They should be ready to go around; at your command; even when the approach is good; and you're surprising them with the command.

Drone flying is continuing to pose a threat to aviation. In this case; it was flying at night over a huge metropolitan area. If this aircraft; and drones are exactly that; would have hit us; the results could have been catastrophic. Regulations are going to have to be put into place and enforced.

While approaching Hanford Municipal Airport (HJO) after a short local flight in a Cessna 120; I started making voice reports at 6.5nm northwest indicating my intentions of flying overhead the field from the west at pattern altitude; then turning to the right downwind for runway 32. A Bellanca 7ECA was already established in the pattern; doing touch and go landings. When at 5nm from the field; a Cessna/Columbia 400; reported 14 miles north and approaching for landing; after which the 7ECA and I updated our positions. The Columbia 400's response was that he was approaching at 1;400 feet and 180 knots. When at 2 miles west of HJO; I reported my position and altitude of 1;000MSL and called both aircraft in sight: the 7ECA was extending upwind (approximately 1 mile) and I caught a glimpse of the Columbia 400 at the north end of the city of Hanford; approximately 5nm north; tracking west-to-east at a much greater speed than I (90 knots).  The Columbia reported the 7ECA in sight and the 7ECA then reported the Columbia in sight while in his crosswind turn.  The Columbia then passed to the left; then ahead of the 7ECA; passing him in the pattern. Simultaneously; he reported both aircraft in sight; explicitly stating he would follow behind us on downwind.I entered the traffic pattern overhead the midfield point at 1;100 feet MSL with both aircraft in sight. The 7ECA was in a crosswind turn 2-3 miles north of the field. I asked on the CTAF 'Is it your intention to be number one on downwind?' The Columbia was at my altitude or slightly lower; to my left approximately 1/2nm away and on a constant-bearing-decreasing-range course as I started my crosswind turn. I deviated by climbing; dipping my left wing down to maintain sight as he descended. The Columbia 400 pilot's response was 'I'm doing 160 knots' as he descended and passed directly underneath my nose. I estimate the pass to be within 500 feet. I completed my turn to downwind; followed the Columbia 400 in the pattern and executed a go-around due to improperly timing my base turn behind the Columbia 400.

It started just like any day and I had been well rested and ready to work.  The second time I was on position I was working East/West combined up in the tower on the DBRITE.  It was average workload with three same type of aircraft in the radar pattern for GPT and HSA combined along with a VFR and a couple arrivals/departures during the session.  After Aircraft X did a couple approaches at GPT he wanted to go to HSA to complete the RNAV runway 18 full stop.  I cleared him and gave him a vector to set him up for the approach.  I had another aircraft that was holding for the RNAV for 18 over STENN.  I cleared the other aircraft and he began his approach.  The winds had been quite gusty most of the day and the aircraft were going fast on the downwind and then would slow down significantly once the made the turn onto final.  When I gave Aircraft X his turn to final he was going over 200 knots which I expected to die down significantly when established on final.  I also gave him the aircraft in front of him's speed to let him know he would be following traffic and the speed they indicated.  I noticed that he was going through final and asked if he needed a new vector to join.  He said no and it was at that time I noticed the sequence looked like it was not going to work.  I used the distance measuring tool on the ARTS key pack and it looked just over 3 miles and Aircraft X was still 60 knots faster.  I cancelled the approach clearance and gave him a vector of 270 and to maintain 020 for altitude and proceeded to resequencing him.  When I looked at the FALCON to see the exact measurements of how close it was; it seems that I had in between 2.7 and 2.8 miles before he made his turn into the heading given.  When working the DBRITE and having approaches into HSA it is a little harder to measure the exact distances to ensure you have the full mileage you need.  I also underestimated the speed of Aircraft X when he turned onto final as every aircraft had been slowing tremendously when turned onto final.  Do not anticipate speeds based on winds as each aircraft may fly it differently than the other.If you know that it's harder to watch your exact mileage when operating on DBRITE make sure to give extra separation to be sure. If it becomes close go ahead and cancel the approach clearance and act immediately instead of any hesitation.",,,,"GPT Controller; while working a radar position; had numerous aircraft of the same type at a couple of different airports.

Assigned speeds were working for all aircraft with a slight overtake with Aircraft X catching Aircraft Y and I issued crossing restrictions to all three aircraft. I was monitoring the speeds in the descent and noticed that Aircraft Y slowed by another 10 kts instead of increasing as I expected; and I asked 'Aircraft Y are you going to be able to maintain the assigned 310 kts?' to which they responded 'Negative; we're slowing to 270 kts'. There was now a significant overtake; so I told Aircraft Y to amend altitude and maintain FL270; and it was read back correctly. I then told Aircraft X to slow to 260 kts and turn 20 degrees left. Aircraft Y comes back and says they were already through FL270 when the clearance was issued and they were descending to FL260. It appeared as though separation was lost before the turn of Aircraft X took effect. I believe fatigue was a direct cause of this event; I was about one minute too late in turning Aircraft X to prevent a loss; and was about three minutes to late in ensuring that assigned speeds were indeed working. Another contributing factor however was that Aircraft Y did not comply with the speed that was assigned and did not inform me of that decision.",,,,"ZJX Controller describes a loss of separation between two aircraft.

Traffic was not very heavy and we closed the GLNR. The position was combined as VLYR/PASR/GLNR. Towards the end of the session it was clear the weather was getting worse despite any updates on the SAIDS [Systems Atlanta Information Display System]. It was reported as 'hazy' and aircraft going to both VNY and SMO were requesting to pick up an IFR for the approach. I had a [small] aircraft that was inbound from LHS to HHR who needed to go eastbound via V186 descending out of 11;000; a SLI transition at 9;000; a SMO inbound from PMD at 8;000; a VNY inbound from POMR at 6;000; and a WHP departure to DVT climbing to 5;000 eastbound V186. The SMO lander was a J class and informed me he could not do the GPS-A. I knew the haze was restricting a good view of the airport until they got about to DARTS and down to 3000. Aircraft X to DVT checked on during this time; which I acknowledged but didn't pay close attention to. I had to vector the jet out for descent and down to 7000 versus the VNY arrival at 6000 as well as the high MVA terrain clearance so that I could then turn him back to make his descent. I was cutting the VNY arrival in on incremental vectors trying to avoid the higher MVA to the north and shorten the crossing point between him and the jet in order to descend him. At this time I noticed Aircraft X climbing through 5200. For some reason; I interpreted his data block as VFR and he had the VNY arrival traffic opposite direction at 6000. I instructed him to 'Maintain VFR at or below 5500'. I believe he read that back; but I don't recall if he questioned the clearance until later. At this point; the jet and the VNY arrival were beginning to cross and I issued a descent to 6000 for the jet SMO arrival. That is when the specialist working Flight Data (FD); who was watching; informed me he believes Aircraft X is IFR not VFR; which was obvious when I refocused on the aircraft. I issued Aircraft X a descent to 5000. He queried me about the altitude saying this would put him back in 'soup'; which to me indicated he had taken the VFR clearance. And I replied; verify you are 'IFR'; to which he replied 'affirmative'. I told him he could expect higher with the next controller. I stopped the SMO arrival's descent at 6500 since he would have been traffic for Aircraft X as well. Once he was clear; I vectored the SMO arrival back around and he reported the airport in sight once he got down and closer. Closest point was 5500 for Aircraft X versus the VNY arrival. I admit I was a bit worn out coming into this shift. I am the Training Rep for our area and need to maintain 16 hours a month for currency. Due to training needs; I was not able to secure much time earlier in the month. I had worked 4 straight morning shifts from roughly XA30 to XK30; and then a morning OT shift yesterday. I had to get up early this today for an event for my son and came straight from it to work. It is possible the confluence of low time on the position; fatigue from working a number of shifts in a row; the early non-work related start of the day with the sudden rise in traffic volume and decreasing weather were factors in me not recognizing the IFR state of the aircraft on initial contact. We have lots of VFR traffic that flow through this route out east; and the non-SoCal destination may have also led to the incorrect assumption on my part. If the aircraft had not climbed to 5200; it is likely I would have been wary of the altitude on second glance; but once the pilot continued to climb past 5000; using the VFR assumption; I gave him the 'VFR' restriction.Part of the problem is the topography of the sector itself. We can't get SMO and eastbound traffic down quickly due to the terrain so almost all activity takes place around DARTS. That said; recognizing the aircraft as IFR on initial contact would have prevented the situation as I was not unaware of his presence; just his status. Including myself; we had 2 Overtime workers this shift. The BUR Area has been clamoring for more developmentals for years; and since the number of incoming trainees has not been steady; we are faced with constant shift shortages as our numbers are depleted by retirements. It is not uncommon for everyone in our area to be scheduled one or more overtimes and we are going to be in a constant state of 'catch-up' because any new trainees we get now are simply going to be too late due to the amount of training time it takes to get certified.",,,,"SCT TRACON Burbank area Controller reports of a busy shift; lack of staffing and a combined position he is working.

I climbed him to FL320. Ask him to say the SOCCO estimate; Mach number and altitude request. He requested FL370 M.75 and gave an estimate of SOCCO at XA28Z. My D-Side told me that FL370 was not available and to stop him at FL340. I did and the pilot stated that he was a medical flight and that at FL340 he would not reach his destination. D-side informed me that next available was FL390. I asked if he was able and he said yes. I climbed him and told him to give me a good rate of climb for traffic cause he was climbing good and continued working the outbound push out of SJU; STT; TNCM and COY. Sector 6 was very busy but it was do able; when I continued my scan I saw Aircraft X slowing his rate of climb. I did my calculations and knew it was going to be a factor with Aircraft Y. I called him and assign a 360 heading with no reply from him. Told him to expedite; no reply. At this time he was floating FL361; next hit; FL362. My scope was filled with targets and he wasn't responding. When he finally responded was questioning if the heading assignment was for him. Sector 6 was getting busier by the minute and this guy wasn't responding. He was already in ZNY's airspace when I saw him turn leaving 366. I called the Aircraft Y to verify his position; no luck. Told the D-side to contact commercial radio to put him on our frequency. Nothing. I continued working and never got a read back that the aircraft was leveled at FL390. I transmitted on the blind; no answer. I continued to call Aircraft Y with no luck. He finally came on frequency 80 miles after. I radar identified him and kept working when he asked if he had traffic approaching SOCCO. I explained to him that I had lost communications with him and that's when he told me that he had responded to a RA (resolution advisory). I never saw how close they got since it happened on non-radar. Our frequencies over the ocean are bad. We transmit constantly with no answer. Transmitters and receivers are constantly malfunctioning and is a daily headache. This situation could have been avoided with good frequencies.",,"I was given a quick briefing.

Don't know how long I was on position but ZNY called me up to tell me Aircraft Y had to respond to a resolution advisory (RA). I replied roger and that was it. Kept working because it was too busy. I yelled out for at least a tracker for my radar man but there wasn't anybody. I really didn't know who Aircraft Y was in conflict with; until now. Frequencies were congested and were not working properly for what I could hear from the R-side. Frequencies need much better coverage/range. Staffing needs to improve drastically. We need the TMU (traffic management unit) up and running as soon as possible. They could have seen this coming. Supervisor needs to be more attentive to what's going on each sector and how are they going to be impacted. If R6 gets slammed by traffic; R2 is going to get it very soon.

There are no NavTracks at this time of day east bound so we were on a random route. I was the IRO (Relief pilot) and on break when the oceanic clearance was received. The clearance was a reroute.I returned to the flight deck at XC35 Zulu and was getting settled in when we crossed N50W050. Minutes after crossing 50W Gander messaged us to call on HF. When we checked in with Gander he asked for our north coordinate at 30W. We both checked the FMS and then decided to verify against the printed clearance. The FMS was incorrect. We verified with Gander that our reroute clearance and coordinates were correct and changed the FMS to reflect the correct clearance. Our 40W coordinate were the same (original route and reroute) so we never turned off course.All three crew members then silently verified the clearance (the 3rd was recalled to the flight deck). Then the pilot monitoring (PM) read the coordinates out loud to the pilot flying and the FMS coordinates were confirmed. No further action was needed. We never turned off course and landed safely at destination.",,"We received our random route oceanic clearance at about the same time that the ride deteriorated at our flight-planned crossing altitude. We climbed to FL390 and asked Moncton to forward a request for Gander to re-clear us to cross at the higher altitude. He complied and we received that clearance. We followed SOP in the route confirmation process and everything looked normal. We were given direct to 50N050W and proceeded accordingly. Following the crew change and soon after passing 50N050W and now navigating to 51N040W; we received a CPDLC message from Gander Radio to contact them on 8831; which we did. He told us he couldn't read our north coordinate at 30W on the position report and to please confirm what our clearance showed. We checked and found that we still had our originally filed points of 50N030W and 50N020W in the FMC and not the cleared points issued to us of 51N030W and 51N020W. We changed the points and sent the info to dispatch. The leg we were on (to 51N040W) was correct so a Gross Navigation Error didn't happen but we unintentionally set ourselves up for one. I don't know if the Gander Radio operator couldn't actually read the report or if that was a tactful way of saying 'Check your planned flight route because what I see doesn't match.'  The most ironic thing about this almost-incident was that the Captain and I had quite literally just finished re-reading the Atlantic oceanic route clearance procedures in the FOM. In spite of that; we still managed to miss digit changes on two points! We apparently saw-and/or-read what we expected to see instead of what was actually there.As a side note; we did not receive the normal required message from ATC stating that the clearance we received was different from the filed route. We think this might have happened because the Moncton controller relayed the message concerning our ALTITUDE change and he had no knowledge of the oceanic ROUTE change so he didn't say anything. We think the Gander controller probably believed that we were verbally informed of the route change at the same time that we received the altitude change. Even though we didn't receive the verbal; we still had a piece of paper in the cockpit that did have the changes and we missed them.",,"An air crew received a revised random route clearance prior to entering oceanic airspace.

I asked the de-ice crew over the radio what was going on and what their plans are. The response I received was that they were 'waiting for the hydraulic fluid that was spilt on the heat exchanger exhaust to burn off'. They also said; 'Our mechanic has already looked at it and said it will clear soon'.I observed the de-ice crew then opening the rear access doors to the truck and when they opened them it appear to give whatever was burning a lot more oxygen and the smoke intensity increased significantly. After that observation I pleaded with them over the radio to not use the truck and shut it off based on my prior experience operating that type of equipment. They again re-affirmed that everything is fine based on what there mechanic told them and that 'a manager' had cleared them to use the truck.We had the aircraft configured for de-ice prior to these conversations. Before I could get another word in the de-ice crew jumped in the burning truck and proceeded to de-ice our aircraft. The crew would not respond to my radio calls for them to stop until I told them that I could smell the fumes in the cabin.As the deiced truck passed the Captain's side of the aircraft I observed flames coming from inside the de-ice truck (the rear access doors were left open by the de-ice crew the whole time; which in itself is a safety risk and not a standard operating procedure for anyone). The crew eventually moved the truck away from the aircraft. After I observed the flames I radioed ground control to call the fire department; as the de-ice crew was still not addressing the situation. After the fire department showed up; the de-ice crew came back on the radio and said they would be getting a different truck.It is still snowing and the same crew showed up with the new de-ice truck and started to de-ice us from the point they stopped with the old truck; and at a speed that would not make it possible to properly de-ice the aircraft. Before I could ask them what they were doing and why they did not start the process over again they were telling us over the radio that they were done and our aircraft was clean. There was no possible way that they could have cleared the aircraft of the old failed fluid; and re-applied new type I and IV.I explained to them that they would have to start the process over. The crew was getting very aggressive over the radio. Another flight then radioed 'this is (XXX); we will take it any way you want to give it'. The truck then left us and de-iced them. We had to then wait for the de-ice crew to return and de-ice us properly. The threat was the complete lack of understanding of the situation by the ground crew. That signal threat made it impossible for myself to accept the de-icing job they were doing.During this event I was on the phone multiple times with my dispatcher and the hub coordinator. Other than to talk to the dispatcher to explain why we were delayed; and to adjust the release and account for the additional fuel burned on the ground during the delay; I as the captain should not have to request that the ground crew do their job properly. I should never have had to debate and plead with the ground crew not to take risks with their safety; as well as mine and the passengers. The risks they took were completely unacceptable.",,"[Report narrative contained no additional information].",,"EMB-145LR flight crew reported while they were getting de-iced they noticed smoke coming from the de-ice truck and became concerned about fire danger to their aircraft.

They were mostly occupied talking to other aircraft on frequency. We were finally able to ask for a lower altitude when the frequency cleared at about 25 NM from the airport. Instead of giving us lower; the controller sent us to Hermosillo Approach. We checked on with Hermosillo approach; and the new controller immediately gave us 'Descend to 6;000 feet and cleared VOR DME-2 RWY 23 approach'. At this point we were 20 NM out and still FL200; with the airport in sight. We were unable to accept this approach and told him that we were too high to accept. He denied our request for a visual approach. He came back irritated; and told us 'fly direct to the VOR and enter the published hold; maintain 6;000; then cleared the approach'. This was confusing right away; and after looking at the approach; turned out to be an invalid clearance. The HMO VOR is not an IAF for the approach we were given; and there is no transition to an IAF from the VOR. The controller gave us no instructions on how to begin the approach. About 10 miles out; the approach controller asked us if we were really going to need to enter the hold. We told him that we were way too high; and that we would either need to hold and descend; get vectors to descend; or just do a visual approach. He did not respond. We told him again with no response. Then he called our flight number asking for a response. We answered; but he didn't respond.At this point it was evident that we had lost communications with Hermosillo Approach. We were about 3 miles north of the airport at 10;000 feet. We had a clearance from approach that didn't make any sense. Just before we were going to enter the hold over HMO; we made the decision to contact HMO tower and then we tried to explain the situation. Hermosillo tower figured our position (over the airport at about 7;500 feet) and told us to enter a left base for runway 23. At that point it seemed to us like all clearances were out the window. We continued descending right through 6000 feet on crosswind now on the south side of the airport. Then Hermosillo tower told us to maintain 3;000 and contact approach again. We leveled at 3;000 and switched to approach. We were still flying SE on a crosswind for RWY 23. Approach just wanted to scold us for not complying with his clearance. We told him that we had lost communications; and he informed us that we did not lose communications. We decided not to argue since we were now at 3;000 feet with pattern traffic and terrain nearby. He told us to maintain 3;000 feet and contact tower. We went back to tower and she told us to maintain 3;000 feet and enter a left base for RWY 23. From there on in it was a normal approach to landing except for the fact that tower had no intention of letting us descend below 3;000 feet until we asked at the last moment.We were left very high. Center forgot to ship us to approach. Approach gave us a clearance that we weren't able to comply with; and then issued another clearance which was invalid. Then Approach stopped talking to us. We left frequency without being switched; and then complied with the next controller's clearance which actually made sense.I'm fully willing to admit when I'm wrong; but I feel that we did just about everything that we could do here. If I had to do it again; I would have entered the hold over the VOR as cleared and tried harder to work out the invalid clearance with approach control.This was mainly caused by an approach controller that issued a poor clearance and then either couldn't hear our transmissions or heard and chose not to respond to them.",,,,"CRJ-200 Captain reported ATC communication difficulties on arrival to MMHO.",

The Pilot Flying was slightly high according to the PAPI with speed at Vref +/- 0 Kts. It is the Pilot Not Flying's duty to call out any deviations but the Pilot Flying had already acknowledged that he was 'correcting' the higher/steeper (but on-speed) approach.Touchdown was on the touchdown markers at approximately Vref -10 and I monitored the N1 gauges for the amber then green 'REV' annunciation (expecting only the left as the right was deferred) but never saw either. My attention then was to the Air Speed Indicator were I saw (and felt) normal deceleration then outside to judge if we were in danger of overrunning the runway (I judged that we would not) then back to the ASI; I called 75Kts as we decelerated then focused my attention outside to assure myself that we would stop on the runway or taxi off normally.We exited the runway normally at the intersection that was briefed during the approach briefing. As we exited the Pilot Flying said 'the left engine has flamed out'. I looked down and saw that the left Thrust Lever was in the cut-off position and saw the PF turn off the left generator. He did not turn off the left boost pump so I reached up and turned off the left boost pump.At that time ground control called and mentioned that they believed that they saw some 'smoke' coming from the left engine and asked if we needed assistance. We checked for any indication of fire; found none so we taxied to the gate normally (single engine). Post flight inspection detected no abnormalities of evidence of fire/problem.The PF asked after the flight if I had noticed when the engine flamed out. I did not. While I was watching for the 'REV' indications; I did not take notice of N1 (or any other engine indications) nor is it my normal practice to do so. So; I cannot say with any certainty when or if the engine flamed out prior to being shut down. I also do not recall any single or triple chime caution/warnings during the approach/landing (although I was expecting a thrust reverser warning on the rollout because of the deferred right thrust reverser).Per our SOP; during the landing rollout; the Pilot Monitoring is to look for the thrust reverser indications and monitor airspeed. It is not the PM's duty to monitor the engine gauges. Any engine malfunction will likely go unnoticed by the PM during the landing rollout.I am relatively new to this aircraft so my perception of what is happening is still narrow but widening. Additional experience in the aircraft will make me more familiar with normal engine indications during all phases of flight and would allow me to better notice and communicate any abnormalities to the Pilot Flying. This is not to say that I am incapable of performing my duties or need additional training. I feel that I am capable and competent in this aircraft but experience will further expand my practical knowledge and fine-tune my skills.",,,,"CRJ-200 FO reported the left engine flamed out on landing roll.",

Weather was light snow; night; 1-2 NM visibility and the ceiling was 700 OVC. I disconnected the autopilot for the HUD CAT III at about 2;000 AGL. I started experiencing vertigo and started deviating from the course. The FO properly called out the deviation; and I elected to go-around. Still suffering from my disorientation; I performed a poorly executed go-around and I over sped with the flaps in the 15 and 10 degree positions. (Max overspeed of 11 kts. at flaps 15) After level off; I had the FO take the aircraft and fly the approach and landing. FO performed an outstanding job during the entire event.",,"The Captain was the flying pilot; on approach he configured the aircraft to land and disengaged the autopilot at about 1;500 feet on the radar altimeter; to do a CAT 3 approach to runway XXL. Everything was normal and as briefed at this point; and the before landing checklist was completed. Weather conditions were as I best remember; snow and freezing rain; visibility was 1/2 mile and ceiling was 700 ft overcast. I noticed small localizer deviations at first; then a half dot deviation on glide slope; all of which I called out to the Captain. He made a correction every time; and I attributed this to the winds at about 250/58 kts at 1;500 ft shifting to somewhere about 220/4 kts on the surface and also some turbulence we encountered. I had no indication that the Captain was ill or incapacitated at all. The Captain then said 'I messed up; going around' as he pressed TOGA. I raised the flaps to 15 degrees and called out that I was doing this as the Captain had not called for it. At that point we both called positive rate; he called for gear up; and I raised the gear while calling tower to inform them of the missed approach. I was at that time still under the impression that the Captain had somehow not been set up properly for the approach; and that was the cause of the deviations and go around.Tower assigned us runway heading and 3;000 ft; which was set in the altitude window for missed approach; and asked us the reason for the go around. I saw the aircraft was turning to the right in a shallow bank; so I pressed heading and told the Captain to stop turning; we were instructed to fly runway heading. I then saw our speed approaching 200 kts as the captain turned further right and entered a descent. I called out for him to stop the turn and descent as I raised the flap handle. During this time the tower stated they saw us in a right turn and assigned us a new heading; I think 250; and again asked us the reason for the go around since I had not answered that previously. Since my attention was diverted towards getting the aircraft in a climb and on the correct heading; and the Captain also failed to call for flaps to come up; we over sped with the flaps at 15 and 10 degrees. The Captain then told me he was experiencing vertigo and to take the aircraft. I then took control of the aircraft; got it leveled off at 3;000 ft and on the assigned heading; and engaged the autopilot. I asked the Captain if he was ok; and he said he was ok at that point; the vertigo had passed but we both agreed that I should continue to fly. I then set up for another approach; this time a CAT 1 ILS XXL; briefed it; and flew it to a safe; uneventful landing. The Captain took control at taxi speed and taxied to the gate.In retrospect; I believe the Captain actually said 'I'm messed up.' If I had heard this correctly it would have given me a clue a little earlier that something was wrong and I could have taken the aircraft earlier; my attention would not have been diverted; and the flaps would not have been over sped. This is not the first time I have experienced degraded cockpit communications due to the noise level of the aircraft. Throw in a heavy workload and increased ATC communications and it makes the problem worse. [My previous airline] has an intercom lock switch so the pilots can communicate through their headsets without pressing to talk each transmission; and also issues noise canceling headset to their pilots. The intercom lock would have been very helpful during my flight and every 737 flight; but instead we are reduced to shouting and miscommunications; since it is too difficult to fly and push to talk each time you have something to say. The Captain I was flying with was unable to communicate effectively to me about his temporary vertigo. Why are we at [my current airline] lacking such an important safety feature that can also prevent hearing loss in our 737 pilots?",,"B737-800 flight crew reported the Captain experienced vertigo during an instrument approach so a go-around was executed; and the FO flew the subsequent approach.",

At some point before reaching the Long Island Sound I climbed to 4;500 feet in order to cross the open body of water at a higher altitude. And failing to descend to an altitude below the shelf; did inadvertently fly through the New York Bravo airspace without proper clearance.Flying in the area all of my flying career; I normally don't have qualms about crossing the Long Island Sound and have done so many times at 3;500 feet.  Maybe because it was dusk and the sound appeared more menacing; maybe it was because I was going to a safety seminar where my good friend was going to talk about his incident out of FRG. But for some reason I made a last minute decision to climb to a higher altitude of 4;500 feet; thinking that it was better to be higher when crossing the water. Of course I know about the super Bravo; I've been flying through it with clearances and all around it since I first learned to fly. I love the NY Bravo; it's a source of pride; part of being a New Yorker pilot to have the privilege to competently share the skies with the heavies and fast talking TRACON personnel.  And; I know that when I fly into FRG I need to duck under the shelf.  It's true that an error or mistake is never the result of just one decision--there were four faulty decisions that lead to me busting the airspace. Four links in the error chain.The first link in the error chain involved a last minute route change. The original flight plan included a stop at BDR to pick up a friend who would also attend the seminar. But at the last moment; my friend called to say he couldn't make it and I simply did a Direct-To from POU to FRG.  If I had of focused more on the nagging thought that occurred to me that I'd never gone direct from POU to FRG; I might have remembered the reason I never do that route direct was that it would mean I'd have to fly below the Bravo shelf and over the water at less than 3;000 feet; at about 2;500 feet. I made a last minute route change without fully contemplating the effects on altitude and other flight aspects.The next link was the contemplation of my friend's good fortune at having survived his incident last summer and how lucky he was to have survived.  He and others have often said that his survival was due largely to his decision-making at the time.  I was thinking about how he was departing FRG when he had to declare an emergency; he was flying to ZZZ; when disaster struck him.  I was following the same route and I; too; wanted to be safe and these thoughts led me to do an act of over caution by climbing higher without proper route consideration.  Another link was over reliance on a new function of the panel-mount GPS; the GTN-650.  I've had it for several months and until I got the software upgrade last month it didn't automatically show the floor and ceilings of controlled airspace on the map page.  Therefore; before last month; I'd use my iPad Foreflight app for quick reference for place and height of controlled airspace.  One of the recent upgrade features is that now the GTN does show airspace ceilings on the map page.  In an effort to declutter the cockpit; I turn off the iPad when it's not directly needed for something I can't quickly retrieve from the GTN; before last month's GTN upgrade I always got airspace limits from the iPad.  So unlike normal circumstances; I was relying of seeing the airspace altitude indicator on my panel mount GPS map page as my cue for knowing when I was near controlled airspace.  Lastly; I should have used flight following and had decided against it for no good reason; and that was a mistake.  With flight following I would have been cleared into the Bravo or at least they would have told me to stay clear of it--in either case; I would have been alerted. The first error chain was the last minute routing change without proper thought. The approach to FRG would have allowed meto overfly the Long Island Sound for the entire route without entering the Bravo.  Preoccupations with a matter outside of the scope of the current flight lead me to act differently by climbing to an altitude not normally used for that direction of flight and mission.  Still being somewhat unfamiliar with my new GPS software; I should have left the trusty iPad on for ease of reference.  And; furthermore; the whole event would have been a nonevent had I used flight following.  Actually; if; in fact; I had acted differently on any of these points I doubt I would have made inadvertent flight through NY's controlled airspace without proper clearance.Unfortunately; I unknowingly entered the Bravo at 4;500 feet before I even reached the Sound.  I didn't notice because I didn't expect to reach the Bravo until I was over Long Island land mass--which would have been true for my original approach coming from BDR.  Once on Long Island; I began a 500/fpm descent to 2;000 feet and turned on the iPad to see a taxi diagram for FRG.  When it opened on the map page I saw my airplane georeferenced inside the Bravo at about 4;000 feet and descending. Horrified I increased the descent to 2;000fpm to get below the floor of the shelf.  I still hadn't grasped that I'd been inside the shelf since before overflying the Sound.  Being about 12 miles from FRG; I busied myself with getting the ATIS and radioing the tower with my intent to land.  Now; it was well past sunset and the lights of Long Island made it difficult to pick out the airport and I didn't see it until I was about 3 miles away.  I made my position report on downwind runway 01 and was cleared first to land. Still getting darker and the city lights getting brighter; I lost the airport on my downwind to base turn and began hunting for it.  The ATC controller noticed and told me I was west of the airport and she would blink the runway lights.  Bingo; there it was and I straightened out my base; made final and landed uneventfully.

Recently the calm runways changed from the standard 7 and 12 L/R to using 30 L/R which renders 7/25 useless for traffic. Practice IFR approaches are on 12 which is a conflict with aircraft departing 30 and doing pattern work. Even with a tailwind 30 L/R is still being used. Having worked in airline management and training pilots I cannot understand the reason for this. I am writing a safety report for the third time in my entire career because I believe there will be a fatal crash at VGT in the future if there are no changes. In addition; controllers are being trained which is understandable but their supervisors are not taking over early enough when there is a problem developing.Recently I intended to do touch and goes. The tower told me to fly runway heading then called my crosswind. I was at pattern altitude of 3000 MSL. A cessna approaching the airport from the west over the departure end of 30L was also at 3000 feet and closing. The TCAS warned me and I dove 400 feet to avoid a direct collision then saw him fly overhead at 3000 feet. I told the Tower who by then had taken over for the trainee controller and told me to fly to the [local landmark] then called my base turn. On a base descent for landing a helicopter flew directly in front of me who I also had to avoid. I again told the tower what had just happened then said I would just land instead of a touch and go.A week before; another pilot who was flying with me and observing traffic had a similar situation and instead of doing touch and goes decided it was too dangerous at that point and landed.

On some occasions; I elect to run the auxiliary fuel system to complete exhaustion; in order to consume all available fuel and to verify the fuel gauge empty indication. This procedure; while not used on every flight; has never resulted in a problem in an engine immediately resuming operation upon returning fuel supply to the main tanks after the first indication of fuel starvation as the auxiliary tanks are run to exhaustion. In this case; however; the Left Engine failed to resume normally after returning to the main tanks. Attempts over a 2-3 minute period to restart following the checklist procedure failed to result in the engine restarting. Rather than continue in the high-drag configuration with the propeller wind milling; and unclear as to the reason for a failure to restart; I elected to feather and secure the Left Engine; and land. ATC was helpful and responsive in providing nearest airport and runway information; and suggested a turn to [nearest suitable airport]; where a controlled and uneventful single-engine landing was made with no damage to the aircraft and no injuries. When on the ground; I consulted by telephone with my home-field mechanic who suggested a series of steps to determine any discernable cause.  After roughly 1 hour on the ground; with air temps in the 50's F; and with the fuel selector left in the mains position as it was during the last airborne restart attempt; the Left Engine primed and started normally. A high-power run-up and monitoring of fuel flows during a takeoff roll were normal; as was the next flight leg; during which leg the tanks were again switched without a problem. The auxiliary tanks; however; were not run to exhaustion. Note that in no prior case has water or any contamination ever been found in sumping the fuel system; the aircraft is stored in a heated hangar at its home field; and was stored in a heated hangar the night before the flight under discussion.While I cannot be certain that further persistence in attempting a restart may have succeeded; it seemed to me that with continued passage of time the likelihood of restart decreased; and risk to the flight built while the aircraft remained in a high-drag configuration.",,,,"C310 pilot reported the left engine failed due to fuel exhaustion and would not restart when a new tank was selected. Engine was feathered; an emergency declared; and a safe single engine landing ensued.",

A few minutes later; while still above 10;000 feet we were given another clearance to maintain 250 KIAS or greater. As we transitioned through 10;000 feet the captain interpreted the clearance from ATC as to maintain best forward speed. Once below 10;000 feet; we were descending through 9;000 feet and still flying 325 KIAS when the controller asked what our IAS was. Upon read back of 325 KIAS; the controller asked if there was any reason we were maintaining that speed. At that time the captain keyed the mic to explain the clearance and how he interpreted it. The controller responded with a speed restriction to maintain of 200 KIAS. Before handing us off to the next controller; he explained only the FAA administrator has the authority to assign an airspeed greater than 250 KIAS below 10;000 feet.After talking about what happened the captain and I both agreed that the last airspeed clearance verbiage could be cleaned up to eliminate the potential confusion for crews in the future. Another example of a poor choice of verbiage in a clearance given by LAX ATC on our departure from LAX was to maintain 280 or greater in the climb. We were climbing through 8;000 feet when ATC gave us this clearance.

My intent was to descend him to 11;000 feet once he entered my airspace in 1 minute.  I took the handoff on Aircraft Y; who was about 20 miles west of GIGTY at 17;000 feet; eastbound towards GIGTY (I thought).  As I was about to issue Aircraft X a descent clearance; another aircraft; Aircraft Z; questioned a clearance that I had issued to him earlier.  Aircraft Z was originally told to 'Descend via the ROBUC1 Arrival; Runway 33L; resume published speed at BANKI.'  When he was about 6 miles west of Aircraft X he said that he had been given direct ROBUC by the previous controller and asked where he should resume published speed.  I immediately advised the Aircraft Z to maintain FL230; as Aircraft Z could have descended to 11;000 feet.  There is a published window of FL210-230 at GIGTY on the ROBUC STAR.  The next published altitude for an aircraft direct ROBUC is KRANN between 13;000 feet and 11;000 feet.  I was never told verbally or via automation that Aircraft Z was direct ROBUC.  So; I guess that unexpected exchange must have blown a circuit in my brain or something.  Because I completely forgot about descending Aircraft X.  That; combined with a 130 tailwind for Aircraft Y; led to the two aircraft getting close much faster than I expected them to.  I had diverted my attention to the D-Side to fix two routes on a couple of air taxis going from KBED to KISM.  While I was doing that; the Boston High controller; said to me in a loud voice; 'You have two at seventeen.'  I glanced back at the scope and immediately told Aircraft X to descend and maintain 11;000 feet; expedite.  He acknowledged and I then instructed Aircraft Y to turn 50 degrees right; expedite; and issued traffic.  Aircraft Y responded that he was climbing in response to a TCAS RA.  I said roger; but I still need you to turn right (to go behind his traffic.)  Aircraft Y refused the turn; climbed; and I believe that; combined with the expedited descent from Aircraft X; I never lost 3 miles (which we are allowed to use in that area).Links in a chain:  Number 1; I should have gotten control for descent on Aircraft X as soon as I saw the handoff coming my way on Aircraft Y.  Normally there is plenty of time to take care of it in your own airspace.  But that wind aloft was huge and Aircraft Y was converging much quicker than normal.  Normally; he would have passed behind Aircraft X by at least 3 miles.  That's why I wasn't worried.  Number 2.  Sector 19 should have left the ROBUC STAR aircraft on the procedure as required by SOP.  If they had; the Aircraft Z never would have questioned his clearance and I would not have been thrown off my rhythm. Number 3.  It would be nice; if carriers filed a preferential route.  If they had; then I wouldn't have been changing their routes. Number 4.  I've been doing this long enough that numbers 1; 2; and 3 should never be enough to cause this to happen.  I failed to ensure separation.  I got distracted when I shouldn't have.  I had 4 airplanes on my frequency; so this was inexcusable.  This is a humbling job.

We left the autopilot hooked up to help with control but the typical slow throttle corrections had me overriding the thrust settings to keep us out of the over speed and stall regions.  We were initially at FL370 but requested climb to FL390 as we thought we may get out of the turbulence because of the forecast (FL310-370) although this forecast ended about X Airway.  Optimal according to the FMC was approximately FL390.  When we finally attained clearance (CPDLC) and climbed it was actually worse and only reduced our margins.  The whole event was probably 10-15 minutes.  Aircraft control was maintained although the Auto Pilot was having a difficult time maintaining level flight.  I was ready to take over if it kicked off but felt overall it helped to have the Auto Pilot on.  We then asked for FL350 but it took over 3 minutes to get this approved (CPDLC and HF).  The biggest threat I felt was the airspeed changes with violent wind shifts and different velocity of the wind.  We never had an over speed although we were close many times but we had it go into the slow range above stall many times and I was concerned about stalling out this aircraft several times.  Near the end of the event we had the low hydraulic quantity #1 EICAS.

I looked for the class II navigation guide and could not find one in my chart bag nor the spare bag so I completed my preflight duties from memory. I was interrupted and distracted numerous times with load planning issues and other operational intrusions. We pushed back and departed late. After we were airborne and things settled down in cruise I got my IPAD out and reviewed the class II navigation guide.  That is when I realized that the Pre Departure Service Check (PDSC) for my ETOPS flight had not been completed. I contacted dispatch via SAT phone and thankfully we were able to amend the release to a non ETOPS flight at that time. There were several factors involved with this as the trip is not normally an ETOPS flight. There must be a disconnect between dispatch and maintenance when it comes to triggering an ETOPS PDSC. (On traditional ETOPS legs an automatic gripe of ETOPS PDSC breaks the MRD and thus prevents an inadvertent departure) my flight had no such gripe.

The [maneuvers check] itself contains too many maneuvers to complete within the allotted time.  For example; despite taking a very short 5 minute break during the 4 hour sim period; we were barely able to complete the entire [check ride]; despite pushing quickly and successively through each required segment.  During the pre-brief; the [instructor] mentioned several times that there were many tasks to complete (both evaluation and train to proficiency) and that it has been a challenge to finish within the planned time.  At no time did either I or my sim partner require additional training; so that was not a contributing factor.  When we got to the Category (CAT) 3 approaches; the [instructor] pre- positioned us at 1000 feet on the ILS.  This did not permit completion of the Precision Approach Briefing Guide.  Day two was the [line-oriented training]; which was given in a [fixed base trainer].  This was the first time I have ever taken a [recurrent training] event in a non-motion simulator.  As usual; the [instructor] briefed that the event should occur in the same realistic way as any line flight; however; there were a few caveats.  First; the visual display is skewed for one of the pilots.  The [instructor] explained that only one pilot would have a visual that was the actual straight ahead view; while the other pilot's view would be skewed.  He also explained that he would move the view; as necessary; so the flying pilot had the accurately depicted view as it would exist if we were actually flying the airplane or full flight simulator.  Second; the FTD does not have the current ACARS 2.0 software loaded; but rather ACARS 1.0; which was phased out of the 737 fleet.  In addition; the ACARS printer does not work in this particular [fixed base trainer].  That would require the pilot who initiates ACARS requests to notify the [instructor] whenever initiating an ACARS request; so he could hand us the torn off slips of paper with ATIS/FWM/Takeoff Data; etc; etc.   I first noticed the skewed visual display during taxi out; as my right-side visual display appeared as if the aircraft was crabbed 30 degrees to the right.  This later became an issue during the crosswind landing; when the non-flying pilot could not effectively determine if the proper wind correction had been applied.  The ACARS requests were also a distraction; as we had to recall ACARS 1.0.After completion of the [line-oriented training]; the [instructor] offered to use the remaining device time to practice the engine failure on final approach maneuver.  After performing several of these; it became even more obvious that the use of a fixed base training device for [this training] is inadequate.  In closing; both days of training were disappointing from an expectation basis.  While the instructors provided quality training to the best of their abilities; the syllabus and [fixed base trainer] were substandard.  I respectfully request feedback from the fleet regarding the following questions:How does the fleet determine an adequate amount of simulator/device time is budgeted for completion of all the assigned tasks/maneuvers?Does the fleet have a quality control plan implemented through which it assesses [training] on a routine basis both for content and volume?  Is it the intent for the [line-oriented training] to be as realistic as possible for a line flight?  If so; how does the fleet expect the [line-oriented training] to be realistic if it is given in a device which does not closely replicate flying the actual airplane on the line?",,,,"B737 First Officer reported his concerns with what he sees as an inadequate recurrent training program at his airline.",

We were set up and briefed for the visual backed up with the ILS to 34R. We checked on with SLC approach and were given a clearance to descend via the LEEHY arrival. I noted that the controller seemed to be busy with lots of other aircraft while listening to the frequency. We were getting near the end of the arrival and we hadn't been cleared for the visual approach. The controller than asked if we had the field; we did; so she cleared us for the visual approach for 34R. We hadn't been given any speed instructions so we were slowly bringing the speed from 250 back to 210 knots. The busy controller than told us to slow to 190 knots. As we were slowing she gave us another speed reduction of 170 knots to the outer marker. We were busy configuring the airplane and she switched us to the tower frequency. I quickly switched frequencies and just as I was getting ready to check in; the tower controller asked if we were on frequency. I said 'yes; and we are on the visual for 34R.' The controller then said there was traffic at our 3 o'clock; had us in sight; and was turning base for 35 and then cleared us to land. We quickly spotted the traffic and kept it in sight as we continued our approach. The other plane was about 400 feet above us but descending and was intercepting the approach for 35 which converges with the traffic on 34R. (Normally traffic on runway 35 does an LDA approach to correct for that; but this plane was on an arrival from the North.) At this point we had been stabilized on the LOC and GS and at our final approach speed. Within a few seconds we received a TCAS TA. We still had the traffic in sight but at this point he was almost on top of us. Soon after we received an RA that told us to descend. The First Officer (FO) was the Pilot Flying (PF) so he disconnected the autopilot and followed the guidance. We descended for about 5 seconds before the guidance said we were clear and should monitor vertical speed. At this point we were about 3 miles from the end of the runway and about 700 feet AGL. We were well below the glideslope and were in visual conditions. The FO asked if we should go around due to being unstable. We were visual and on speed so I told him to just maintain altitude because at that point I was unaware of where the traffic was landing on 35 as well as any traffic that might have been on 34L. I didn't want to execute a go-around into the traffic that was above us. We continued; intercepted the GS again and had an uneventful landing. I had notified the tower controller that we had been following our TCAS RA guidance when we were on the approach.I don't think there was anything that we could have done much differently in this scenario. There was traffic on both sides of us since we were landing on the center runway. The plane on 35 was on a different frequency so I have no idea what he might have been communicating with the tower controller. I'm guessing that tower had asked if the aircraft had us in sight; they probably said they did; and were told to follow us. But I think he saw us and then just turned right at us instead of following us. We were boxed in at that point; and the RA was telling us to descend. We couldn't climb or execute a go-around because we would have climbed into the other aircraft. I don't know if there was a mis-communication between the other aircraft and tower. I believe the other aircraft should have been told to execute a go-around because we were at the lower altitude and therefore had the right of way in this situation. We also could not execute a go-around because again; we would have climbed into the other traffic. As we were exiting the runway; I wanted to communicate with tower about how poorly that situation was handled by the controller. But he was clearing a plane to takeoff right after us and there was another plane coming into land shortly after so he cleared us off the runway and over to ground quickly. I'm not really sure how to prevent this situation in the future. Maybe I could have told the tower to tell the other plane to execute the go-around because we couldn't but I didn't think about that until afterwards.",,,,"A Captain reported an uncomfortable visual approach to SLC that included a low altitude RA and no go-around option because of an aircraft in near proximity above them.",

The plane in question had the autopilot; yaw damper; right side flight director; mach trim and several other MELs listed.  After speaking to both crews and to each other about this situation; both the PIC and I decided it was unsafe to fly this plane with a majority of the automation missing.  The PIC contacted the [Chief Pilot] and informed him of our decision and concerns.  We were then given another tail to sit standby on.    The fact that the company tried to get 3 crews to fly a plane that was quite unsafe is astonishing.  Every recurrent we talk about altitude and navigation deviations being the big 2 issues we have; and yet the company tried to push THREE crews to fly a plane several legs a day for numerous days with the autopilot deferred AND no flight director on the right side with no yaw damper or mach trim.  This increases the workload on the crew exponentially and unnecessarily.  More so; the plane was at a maintenance base at the maintenance facility!  This event never should have happened and further events can be avoided by standing by [our company's] SMS level 4 safety status and fixing a plane that has this many MELs that compromise safety.

The following was excerpted from my fatigue report:As always; the crew used lunch trays and extra blankets to create as much of a lie-flat surface as is possible among the three jumpseats on the back wall of the cockpit. Each of us was given a 2.5-hour rest break. None of us were able to fully fall asleep; at best we were able to doze off on occasion. Because of the complete lack of crew rest on this airplane; by making a make-shift bed along the jumpseats; we block access to the lavatory for hours at a time; and although the operating crew could access the galley; doing so invariably wakes up the pilot trying to rest. In deference to the resting pilot; we keep the lighting in the cockpit to a minimum; making it that much more difficult for the operating crew to remain alert. Even when using the aircraft intercom system; the resting pilot can hear everything the operating crew is saying; despite using earplugs or even noise-canceling headsets. The critical factor is that we're not separated from the crew in any way. No matter what methods are used; someone pays the price - either the dark cockpit makes it more challenging for the operating crew to remain alert; or having the lights up makes it more difficult for the resting pilot to sleep. Either the resting crew blocks access to the lavatory for hours at a time or the operating crew disturbs his rest to use the bathroom. Either the operating crew refrains from using the galley for hours at a time or they wake up the resting pilot as they transit back and forth. Not having a suitable crew rest area is a threat to flight safety; and we have done absolutely nothing on this airplane to improve crew rest in any way since we took delivery.",,,,"A B767-300 First Officer makes a cogent and convincing argument for the inadequacy of the crew rest facility provided by his company to allow for meaningful rest; let alone actual sleep. The facility; three seats across the back of the cockpit which must be creatively modified with meal trays and spare blankets to provide a flat surface on which to lie; results in an intrusive domain for both the crew member at rest and the operating crew inasmuch as they are not separated and some compromise must be reached for adequate lighting and activity for the flying pilots to remain alert but dark enough and quiet enough for the resting pilot to...well...rest.",

Temperature was just above freezing in snow/icing conditions. After engine start and tug push/disconnect; the Captain began moving the [aircraft] over what appeared to be slush and snow on the taxiway. Under that snow and slush proved to be an unobservable layer of ice. On his first attempt to turn; the aircraft did not respond to steering or brake inputs and began sliding. Snow and ice hindered the Captain's control of this slow moving aircraft for several seconds and several feet of motion. With no braking or steering capability; the Captain utilized thrust reversers to finally stop the aircraft. IAD experienced a heavy snow fall the day before this event. On the morning of departure; surface conditions around the aircraft were covered in slush and snow. Temperatures were above freezing and there was a subtle drizzle. Company ramp was plowed but still had what appeared to be a thin layer of mixed elements. Taxi markings were visible. Crew conducted normal engine start and tug disconnect. When ready; the Captain began to taxi at a conservative pace. While attempting to make his first turn; the aircraft did not respond to tiller inputs. Aircraft began to slide on a gradual diagonal to the intended path of movement. Captain attempted to stop aircraft using brakes with no response. Speed of the slide was at the pace of a person's walk. Aircraft did not accelerate but did not slow. With no other options; the Captain applied reverse thrust to stop the aircraft. After sliding several feet; aircraft came to a stop. Contacted ramp representatives and had the ramp deiced before safely continuing the taxi. Maintenance inspected the aircraft and noted no damage to the aircraft or any equipment. Quick thinking of the Captain prevented this event from becoming costly.   Proper snow removal is imperative. Although the area around the aircraft was covered in slush; the remainder of the ramp spaces proved to be solid ice covered in a light rain and snow. If company is responsible for ice removal; they must aggressively ensure safe conditions for taxiing on the ramp beyond parking spaces. If ground crews recognize an excessive sliding in the tug; it must be shared to proactively mitigate any threats to the crew they are pushing. In this case; the crew was properly rested and ready to deal with the adverse weather conditions.

While I was working the traffic; other controllers got in touch with Airport 1; another controller walked out to the catwalk and yelled for the pedestrians to move away from the runway back into the non-movement area. Once the pedestrians were clear of all movement areas I resumed normal operations. Airport 1 was able to get to the pedestrians as they were still on Lima to issue the deviations. Apparently the photographers were there at the request of an aircraft; Aircraft A; to take pictures while they flew the traffic pattern. They made a comment that they told the photographers to stay on the far side of the fence. I think if any pedestrians are being asked to be near the movement area; they should have an escort by someone who knows where pedestrians can or cannot go on the field.",,,,"PAO Controller observes people not authorized near a runway on a taxiway.

Some of the factors that assisted in the complexity were point outs to adjacent sectors; VFR aircraft having trouble staying clear of clouds; and LAX tower's coordination. The main issue with this session that has been a recurring situation is LAX towers coordination. While I was on the line with Point Mugu trying to accomplish a point out on an Aircraft Z that wasn't climbing well; LAX tower keys up in my ear and starts talking over myself and the controller at Point Mugu. I immediately told the tower 'unable' before hearing their request because it was obvious to me that they were calling to APPREQ the request they had flashing in the run down. The LAX tower controller insisted on getting answers on the line while I'm still trying to obtain a point out from Point Mugu before the aircraft gets too close to their airspace. I was left with no choice but to take control of my sector and talk over the LAX tower controller and confirm that Point Mugu had approved my point out. The point out was approved and both Point Mugu and LAX tower got off the line at the same time. This same situation happened again moments later. I had several aircraft I needed to talk to (i.e. radar identify; climb; turn on course; etc.) when LAX tower called to coordinated something else after already not complying with the LOA with Aircraft X. LAX tower keyed up in my ear once again and started talking immediately. I was already way too busy at this time to hear anything else from the tower; I just need the standard operating procedure from the tower. Before the situation in my airspace could become any more out of hand I told the tower to 'get out of my ear'. When the tower controller didn't listen and continued to talk in my ear; I ended up having to block them out as much as possible; talk over them; and continue trying to get my sector back in control. The tower ended up scrambling and stopping Aircraft Y at 2;000 feet below Aircraft X; since I didn't acknowledge Aircraft Y heading 235. Both of these aircraft were going over Gorman and Aircraft Y needed to climb above Aircraft X. So all this ended up doing was creating another problem.Tower's non-compliance with the LOA:Aircraft X was supposed to depart LAX on a 270 heading climbing to 3;000 feet unless it is previously coordinated. This aircraft departed on a 250 heading due to traffic departing SMO. Per the LOA any nonstandard coordination; should be accomplished before the aircraft becomes airborne; either verbal or via rundown patch. LAX tower operates on a daily basis by releasing aircraft for departure without getting acknowledgement from Approach beforehand in hopes they can call last minute and get an acknowledgment. In both situations during this session; neither request by the tower was acknowledged. LAX tower should have to obtain acknowledgement for any non-standard operation before the aircraft is cleared for takeoff. They also shouldn't be allowed to just key up in our ear and start talking over us. Their ability to just start talking in our ear is a risk to operational safety and a major distraction. Their need for coordination about aircraft on the ground shouldn't take priority over the aircraft we have airborne in our airspace.",,,,"SCT Departure Controller describes coordination problems with LAX Tower and the tower not following SOP.",

Aircraft X departed first and was climbed to FL 180 per his flight plan and after meeting MVA requirements was given a turn direct HBU per his flight plan. Then the Aircraft Y departed and during his climb out; unknown VFR traffic became a factor. Traffic was given: '12 o clock; 9 miles; opposite direction; altitude indicates 13;700. Aircraft Y acknowledged. Then Aircraft Z departed behind Aircraft Y with a faster airspeed and faster rate of climb. At this point; I should have turned Aircraft Y; or perhaps increased his speed to ensure positive control between him and Aircraft Z; all while updating Aircraft Y on the VFR traffic. However; I didn't see that Aircraft Z could be a factor with Aircraft Y; because my attention was drawn by Aircraft X. I was unable to perform an automated handoff of Aircraft X due to an unknown system error; so I attempted a verbal handoff with Denver Center Sector 12 controller. Sector 12 controller advised he could see the aircraft but could not accept a handoff because the aircraft was not tagging up. Sector 12 controller inquired to the reason for this discrepancy; asked if I had sent a departure message via FDIO (Flight Data Input/Output); the SUPVR/CIC/Ground controller told me he had tried it. As this exchange was taking place; Aircraft X was too close to airspace boundary to turn back to Aspen airspace without crossing the boundary; so I requested and received a point out from Sector 12 instead of a handoff. After ensuring the point out of Aircraft X; I scanned my departures and called traffic to Aircraft Y again: '11 o clock; 1 mile; opposite direction.' Aircraft Y advised he had traffic in sight and was maintaining visual separation. During this exchange; an approval request was made from another sector for an arriving aircraft and a separate aircraft belonging to Denver was approved in Aspen airspace by my SUPVR/CIC/GC. These two approval requests were not dangerous factors other than the fact that they increased traffic complexity. At this point I observed Aircraft Z for the first time; out climbing Aircraft Y and moving faster. I told Aircraft Z 'radar contact.' I then turned Aircraft Y away from Aircraft Z; then turned Aircraft Z away from Aircraft Y. They never came within 3 miles or 1000 feet of each other. Separation was not lost but I thought it was lost and advised the supervisor that I thought it was lost. I continued to work for approximately 20 minutes. The traffic I worked thereafter was difficult in complexity because of the exchanges that had taken time away from other priorities. I feel the issues worth reporting here are that perhaps the tower was under staffed; and perhaps Denver sector 12 should have taken a handoff on Aircraft X; also if the local controller would have stopped the climb of Aircraft Z or waited to depart the aircraft; this would have helped. I feel nothing of note would have happened if Aircraft X had 'tagged up.'I don't have a recommendation. These circumstances could not have been expected by the supervisor or myself. Traffic was not such that a handoff controller would seem necessary until Aircraft X became an issue.",,,,"ASE TRACON Controller reports of ASE Tower sending three aircraft off the runway into his airspace that needed to be separated more.

It had had two previous write-ups for the illumination of the engine driven LOW PRESSURE light on the B-system. The aircraft was originating in the evening due to the replacement of the engine driven hydraulic pump earlier that day. On initial climb (a little before FL 180); we also received the same LOW PRESSURE light. Our B-system quantity was at 96 at that time. We ran the QRH; which required us to turn off that pump. We continued; and elected to cruise at FL280; due to the QRH suggestion to remain in warmer temperature; in case of cavitation. Later; at cruise; our electric driven B-pump failed; and we noted that the quantity had gone to zero. We also received the FLT CONTL light; due to the yaw damper failure. The Captain was PF; so the autopilot remained engaged. We ran the QRH procedures for Hydraulic System-B Failure; and elected to divert since we were near [a suitable airport] and we were not sure that we weren't going to lose the A-system as well. ATC vectored us for a landing. We followed the QRH procedure to lower the flaps and landed uneventfully. After landing; we elected to leave the flaps in the 15 degree position; instead of electrically retracting them.Since the engine driven B-system pump had failed twice before and it failed a third time; the problem clearly had not been diagnosed or repaired properly.

I told him the correct heading to fly and he initially re-intercepted the course and started to descend on the approach. He then seemed to lose situational awareness of where he was on the approach and started to deviate both laterally and vertically from the published procedure. I commanded a go-around which he did initiate. The Tower noted the deviation and I told them that we were 'going around.' We were then vectored back for another approach which was flown successfully and the landing was normal. The weather at the time was reported at 800 broken and six miles; but was in fact at minimums for the LOC/DME BC [RWY] 35L Approach.The problems were as follows: 1. the weather was much lower than reported. I let him continue to fly the approach longer than I should have; thinking we would pick up the runway visually. 2. His unfamiliarity with LOC/BC Approaches. 3.

Because of the increased rate of descent; and 20-knot headwind; we had arrived at our DDA approximately two miles from the field.

We were doing the best we could as we were full; had a good load of fuel and engine and wing ice protection was on; so the aircraft was not accelerating to 250 kts as quickly as she would have liked. The first officer was in the middle of doing the after takeoff checks when she interrupted; and when he tried to reply she didn't answer and he called her back 2 or three times until she responded to tell her we were complying. Our climb to cruise was uninterrupted. When I went to finally set cruise power I realized it was still in the takeoff setting. Upon [landing] I told the maintenance controller the power levers had been left in the takeoff detent and ice protection was on (not a flex takeoff) and he advised it would be alright as FADEC (Full-Authority Digital Electronic Control) monitors all that and if there were any exceedances they would know of it; he asked if there were any status messages and I said no as there weren't and he advised me that we were OK and good to go. I also went to the exceedance history on the MDC and there were none for that day.I have been flying the [CRJ]200 a lot lately as we now no longer stay in one airplane and I obviously didn't pull the power back when I called for ' flaps up after takeoff checks' the first officer; who is very senior and an excellent pilot; missed the thrust setting on the checklist as this was when the controller interrupted us with what I regard as completely unnecessary instructions- simply put we were accelerating as fast as we could- they just let the aircraft behind us take off too soon after our departure. It's very common when pilots have been flying the [CRJ]200 and then get into the [CRJ]700/900 they forget to pull the power back to climb but it's usually caught on performing the after takeoff checklist.

The station manager asked us to move the aircraft because there was another inbound flight that would require the gate our aircraft was currently at. Later scheduling called me with an official request to do so. They asked us to call back to adjust our rest times. The aircraft was going to be under tow to a remote location. We made our way towards the aircraft but my FO was the first to enter and sit at his station. I entered last and upon closing the cabin door I proceeded to arm L1 and L2 doors and call out that I had done that so; in the event of an emergency; we could exit the aircraft. I sat down at my station and we began to discuss our plan of action since we had previously gone through the securing checklist shutting everything down. At this point we knew that we may have to tow the plane with the batteries as the only source of power. I then called maintenance control for guidance on this procedure. The maintenance controller agreed that we might have to do just that because he did not believe that the ground crew was qualified to tow with one engine running. In the meantime my FO tried to contact Ops with no luck. While I was still on the phone with the maintenance controller he got up and went to the back. In a split second I realized he was heading towards the door and shouted to warn him that the doors were armed. Unfortunately it was too late and he opened the door and the slide started to deploy but was stopped by the jetway and just started to unravel. Luckily a mechanic was able to pin the bottle and stop the deploying sequence. My first officer is a capable; professional; and determined team player. He was of much assistance to me throughout the time we were together. Unfortunately even the best of us are susceptible to human error. He accidentally opened the armed door and I assumed that he was aware of the door's armed status. He should have waited until I was done on the phone so we could be on the same page; not just go off by himself. Also the situation we were in was a challenging one because it was cold dark airplane; we were off duty and in a different mindset and there was no checklist for this type of situation.

The relief officer was also in the flight deck. We were cleared Runway 27L WOBUN 3G SID. Transition Altitude was checked prior to departure. Once on the LAA Europe Reference; second on the WOBUN 3G departure page and third on our FMC. Transition altitude was 6;000 feet. After takeoff we were cleared to 6;000 feet. There was some confusion as to whether we should stay on 'QNH' or set 'QNE'. This was all remedied by the time we reached transition altitude of 6;000 feet. We were then cleared to FL080. This was a very quick climb and ATC queried us to check altitude and altimeters. We immediately set 'QNE' and descended to FL080. ATC alerted us of traffic and we confirmed traffic in sight visually. No loss of separation occurred.I think especially important in this instance that 6;000 feet is briefed as the transition altitude and our clearance limit on this particular SID. However; 'QNH' must be maintained at 6;000 feet if we level.  This is totally opposite of USA as Transition Altitude is FL180 and 'QNE' is set at transition altitude. I plan to incorporate after Captains pre-takeoff briefing i.e. before gate departure that if leveling at transition altitude we need to keep current 'QNH' set and not switch over to STD 'QNE'. Also; awareness of resetting all altimeters to STD 'QNE' as soon as vacating the transition altitude for higher Flight Level.",,"Departing LHR on the WOBUN 3G departure off runway 27L we climbed to 6;000 feet. When switched from the Tower to Departure the Captain (Pilot Monitoring) gave our call sign and said we were climbing from 40 to 60 (a common habit I find myself doing in the states; i.e. leaving ORD I would normally tell the departure controller '2 point 8 climbing 5 or some variation Thereof). But of course in the UK they speak of levels under 100 feet in two digit format. So I can see the controllers concern as to our intentions to level at FL 060 vs. 6;000 feet. The controller replied that we were cleared to 6;000 feet. At the same time we were approaching the 'Transition Altitude' (6;000 feet). As per our checklist and state side habit pattern I noticed the Captain reach down and switch to 'STD' altimeter setting. Both the First Officer (Pilot Flying) and I (relief officer) questioned this. As this was the sixth day of our six day trip we were all familiar with each other and the Captain quickly put our input to use and immediately questioned ATC. The controller clarified that indeed we were cleared to '6;000 feet' on a QNH. The captain changed his altimeter back to the QNH setting and the First Officer climbed an additional few hundred feet to be level. We remained at 6;000 feet for some time. Very unusual for LHR to leave us at that altitude for any amount of time in my experience. And I found that contributed to the issue. It felt out of our normal habit pattern.The next series of events happened very quickly. We received clearance to 'climb level Eight Zero'. The captain responded to the clearance and the First Officer input the new altitude in the FMC. I was thinking to myself as the clearance came over the radio and the crew responded that it was 'ok now to change to 'STD' altimeter'. I found myself wanting to say that; but was distracted watching the crew go through the process of verifying the change to FMC and then executing. At moderate weights and low altitudes there is enough reserve thrust for the aircraft to climb aggressively and that's exactly what the aircraft did. For a simple 2;000 foot change the aircraft started up at over 2;000 feet per minute. At the same time as the crew executed the climb command the TCAS gave us a 'TA' and the controller also chimed in with the traffic information. I saw the traffic and called it 'in sight 12 o'clock ' meanwhile the First Officer was busy leveling off and the Captain was busy answering the controllers second call that we were cleared 'level 080 QNH 1013' (i.e. 'STD')As the Captain and First Officer both changed their altimeters and the aircraft was leveling on autopilot the momentum of the climb was going to over shoot our altitude. First Officers disconnected the autopilot and leveled the aircraft at FL080. The traffic was passed us at this point and no conflict occurred but we all realized at the same time that during those few; fast and furious moments that a late change to the altimeters coupled with the performance of the aircraft had contributed greatly to the event. I had the missing piece to the puzzle and didn't speak up before I was distracted by 'waiting for the right opportunity to speak up' and looking for traffic announced by TCAS. It's a bit of an art to providing useful input as an relief officer and not add to the chaos. I believe I should have spoken sooner and in the future will do so weather its needed or not; so as to not miss the opportunity to add a positive piece of information to the crews situational awareness. Perhaps a vertical speed climb for 6;000 feet to FL080 would have produced more time for us to deal with the multiple inputs present in this scenario. The industry seems very focused on automation and 'V/S' climbs seem almost taboo. While it is always the pilots that are responsible to operate the aircraft in the appropriate mode. I think years of focus on automation may lead us down a path of over reliance. I certainlywill remember this lesson and if presented with a similar situation in the future; would elect a vertical speed climb versus VNAV.",,"An air crew on a departure were cleared to 6;000 feet. The Captain was confused about the transition level procedure and set the standard altimeter setting initially until he was corrected.

He stated he needed it for a deviation report.   What happened?   I was ready to leave the airport after having some maintenance done on my airplane.  I tried to contact the tower on what should have been the same frequency I used when I arrived (126.25) earlier.  Getting no response from the tower I taxied from the ramp to the runway for a 24R departure.   Here I attempted to contact the tower three times and received no response.   After receiving no response I departed Runway 24R.  I saw no traffic ground or air.  I thought the tower must have been closed.What I believe happened:  I later discovered my number one radio appears to be intermittent. I found it to be cutting in and out when transmitting.

We had just passed HUNDA by approximately 1 to 1.5 miles and were about to descend through an altitude of approximately 3;000 feet. I was just about to contact tower after being handed off by approach when something caught my eye slightly ahead and to the right of the aircraft. At first I thought it was a large bird soaring towards us; but as it passed outside of the right forward First Officer's (FO) window; I very clearly saw a large square-shaped bright red drone with black accents and black propellers. I had it in sight for approximately 3 seconds as it approached and passed. It appeared to be heading opposite our direction and I would estimate it was only about 50 to 100 feet higher than us when we were passing abeam it and it was probably only between 100 and 200 feet right of us. It was definitely close enough for me to very clearly see it and recognize what it was; but not close enough that I feared it would strike our right wing; engine; or stabilizer. Immediately after we passed it; I checked in with tower and reported that we had just passed a drone inside of HUNDA. The tower controller asked if an estimate of about 3;200 feet altitude for the drone was accurate and I agreed. A few seconds later he asked approximately how far away from us I thought it had passed and what color it was; and I gave a conservative estimate of approximately 200 feet away from us and red with black for the color.I'm not sure there is anything we as pilots or the tower controller could have done to prevent this uncomfortably close encounter between a drone and a large passenger airplane unless these objects are made to be detectable on radar and/or TCAS and traceable to their extraordinarily irresponsible owners/operators.",,,,"A B757 flight crew encountered a UAV on final approach to LAX as they descended through 3;000 feet MSL.",

I am still flying just as crappy trips and sometimes MORE so!? Besides the obvious lack of concern from the company because they are 'following the rules; nothing else they can do' mentality. They constantly violate our contract. I know the latter doesn't appear to be a FAA/NASA problem; but when I'm expecting a meal and then none is boarded or worse; it's bad; I go hungry and get a sugar low. I get light headed and obviously I'm now trapped as I can't go out for 5 minutes and pick up something at the airport [fast food] (which isn't nutrition; but better than nothing). Many times crews are forced to pick up food and eat it enroute (cold) as there is less than an hour between flights. Note: how many gate agents eat cold food while at the gate? Have you ever seen a gate agent eating while boarding a flight? They get 30 minutes every 5 hours to eat. Not us. Worst; reason for this report; is that AFTER a redeye flight to IAH (in this example) we are then forced to fly [three more legs] with NO breaks. After a redeye with only 4-5 hours of sleep?!?! It's bad enough to fly one leg back at the end of a four day trip with redeye on day 3 (that arrives in IAH at XA:09 AM day four); however to make us fly a turn before going home; criminal. My body is sweating and I feel ill because my body doesn't know what's going on after an arrival at XAam. Sure; 12 hours seems like enough time to recoup; but it's not. Most of us only get 3-5 hours sleep; then our body wakes up at XIpm. You CAN'T FORCE SLEEP no matter how tired you are... THEN our stomachs growl and we wake up because either food wasn't on the airplane (airport restaurants are closed when [we] arrive at airport and eating so early doesn't cut it at XAam when stomach growling). Food bars and oatmeal only go so far too. To top it off conditions were windy; icing and other factors. Basically it comes down to this... Do you want to be flying on an airplane when BOTH pilots feel like crap? You can only call in fatigued so many times. I can't call in fatigued every other trip. Not realistic and people have families to support and are scared of retaliation. Lets be dead honest why most people/pilots don't report. They are scared for their jobs. They figure I'll just do this only while I'm junior and when I get senior I don't have to worry with it anymore. So to add insult to injury only JUNIOR pilots are placed in this situation (actually not; FAR 117 now makes all pilots schedules poor)? Bad enough an experienced pilot must go through this crap. I've been reporting about this for 20 years. NOTHING has changed with FAR117 and some things are actually WORSE. I'm just reporting this and filing it away to show a paper trail. Lawyers only care about a paper trail. If it were a desk job; sucks; but that's life. Problem is people's lives (YOUR life one day?) is literally in my hands so why let FAA allow these schedules?

Aircraft Y called Local Controller for taxi clearance; the pilot requested VFR departure to AVL at 4;500 feet; and Local Controller assigned 4;500 feet. Local Controller cleared the aircraft for takeoff. The pilot contacted West Radar; who advised the pilot to proceed on course; and stated 'Altitude your discretion.' The pilot then stated that he 'Would probably go up to about 10;000 feet.' This action put Aircraft Y opposite direction to and converging with Aircraft X; which was 28 miles away in AVL Approach airspace; landing GSP; and descending out of 14;000 feet for 7;000 feet. (West had already accepted a handoff from AVL on Aircraft X.)West called Aircraft X to Aircraft Y. (Aircraft Y was at 10;000 feet; and Aircraft X was descending through 11;000 feet; the aircraft were now 14 miles apart with a closure rate of 600 knots.) He then requested AVL to assign a left turn heading 110 to Aircraft X; AVL advised that he would once the aircraft descended into AVL airspace (upper limit 10;000 feet); and requested West to start Aircraft Y down. No descent was issued.Immediately after this I instructed West Radar to 'Do something to ensure they don't converge.' West then issued a left turn heading 290; and a subsequent turn to heading 270; but this was insufficient to prevent a TCAS RA by Aircraft X; who climbed from 10;100 feet to 10;600 feet before resuming descent. Before switching Aircraft X to West; AVL advised that the aircraft had responded to an RA. The closest lateral proximity was 2.55 miles.The following day I discussed the incident with the trainee; the OJTI; and the trainee's supervisor. Both the trainee and the OJTI believed that Aircraft X would descend below Aircraft Y without any problem. In addition; the OJTI thought Aircraft X was further east than it actually was. (Arrivals from that direction are usually on the UNMAN STAR; which was a few miles east of Aircraft X; it appeared that the aircraft was direct GSP.) The trainee had forgotten that Aircraft X needed to stop its descent at 10;000 feet in order to slow to 250 knots.1. A number of controllers at this facility; including the trainee in this incident; state 'Altitude your discretion' to VFR departures. This phraseology is not consistent with positive control. In this particular situation; the best course of action was to permit Aircraft Y to climb no higher than 6;000 feet; which would have eliminated any chance of a TCAS RA. Had the pilot wanted higher; and his initial request to the tower was 4;500 feet; he could have been given higher with a vector to ensure that Aircraft X was not a factor.2. It appears that many of our newer terminal radar controllers are not cognizant of closure rates; and simply do not realize just how fast two jets can converge with each other. This is an occasional problem on the southwest side of our airspace where we can have arrivals descending from 11;000 feet over ELW VOR with departures climbing to 10;000 feet towards the same NAVAID. During this incident the closure rate exceeded 600 knots; and when the trainee first called traffic; the aircraft were about 80 seconds away from a collision. Greater emphasis on closure rates during radar classrooms at the FAA Academy and at the facility would be beneficial.",,,,"GSP TRACON Flight Line Manager (FLM) reports of a loss of separation by a training team on West radar.

The controller noticed the aircraft was descending below 6;000 feet and advised the crew to set 29.47 inches. The aircraft descended approximately 350 feet below it's assigned altitude. The crew on this flight had experienced a maintenance delay [on departure] and had extended their duty day in order to complete this flight. Two factors contributed to this altitude deviation.

Prior to descent; we had briefed the ILS 24R approach; with a possibility 25L; and completed the Approach/Descent checklist. Just before SYMON; the relief officer mentions that the 24R LOC is out of service and the approach is actually the RNV-Y 24R into LAX. It was printed out on the ATIS; but we all missed that one. The Captain states that he will reprogram the FMC; so I continue to fly the aircraft while he and the relief officer get the correct approach in the box. At one point I hear the relief officer say 'Don't reselect the arrival' which I took to mean not to reselect the STAR. I'm not sure if he did or didn't; but something was executed without my confirmation. The autopilot was in LNAV/VNAV and the flight path was on the magenta line. Between monitoring the aircraft and keeping an eye on what was happening to the FMC I noticed that the plane was not actually on the magenta line but headed straight for SYMON. I selected HDG and attempted to regain the course to BAYST. It was evident to us and to SoCal Approach that we were going to bypass BAYST instead of going over it; and SOCAL cleared us direct SMO; clearly not impressed with our navigation skills. I'm not sure what was programmed into the FMC; or why the plane didn't stay on the magenta line when LNAV was on the FMA. I was not asked 'Does this look good to you?' before anything was executed; probably because there was a time constraint to get the reprogramming done. As pilot flying; I felt my duty was to fly the aircraft while the Captain and relief officer attended to other duties. There was clearly a break down in communications within the crew. There were no personal conflicts between us on the flight deck; and I felt we all got along. Fatigue was definitely a factor. Also; we have all been into LAX a bunch of times and it's always the same arrivals and approaches. Except for this one. Attention to detail is difficult when fatigued; but not impossible. But recovery from an error while fatigued can be confusing and over wrought.

During cruise flight at FL360 enroute the Fire Suppression System (FSS) discharge lights illuminated on the Captain and First Officers (FO) glare shields. At the same time the jumpseaters (two) in the courier compartment notified us via intercom that the FSS display by the L1 door indicated that the FSS had discharged into the container at position 1R. Position 1R contained the Accessible Dangerous Goods (ADG). They also told us that they could not see or smell any indications of fire or smoke. I assumed the worst case. ZZZ was the closest suitable divert (approximately 80 NM south of our position). We [advised ATC of our situation]; started turning back toward ZZZ and were soon given direct ZZZ with a descent to 16;000 feet. I remained the PF; concentrating on getting the aircraft expeditiously; but safely on the deck. My First Officer coordinated with ATC; our jumpseaters; Operations; and ground personnel via ACARS. He reviewed the Quick Reference Handbook (QRH) for any applicable checklists and we reviewed the Evacuation Checklist.  We initially planned RWY 30R (ATIS active runway) but were offered and accepted RWY 12L which was the closest runway. We accomplished all normal checklists and landed on RWY12L with men and equipment standing by. We notified ZZZ Tower of our intention to exit the runway and then evacuate the aircraft. We exited RWY 12L at taxiway K; stopped; heading 030 degrees at the Intersection of Taxiways K and F and initiated an evacuation in accordance with the QRH. I made the decision to evacuate through the L1 door in the following order: FO; jumpseaters x two; then me. The FO blew the door and the slide inflated. There was a slight hesitation on his part but after a quick exchange with the on-scene firemen he jumped onto the slide like we are trained to do. I was at the back of the line and the next thing I hear is one of the jumpseaters saying that the FO was injured and that he was not going to go down the slide. I looked out the door and saw the FO lying on the taxiway unattended to and in distress; not at the bottom of the slide; but approximately 20 feet left of the fuselage centerline and 20 feet forward of the L1 door. I don't know how he ended up at that location. The firemen were directing us to continue the evacuation on that slide; however; the slide did not look right. From my vantage point all I could say at that time is that it appeared inflated and was resting on the taxiway; but the gradient was very steep and the end of the slide appeared closer to the aircraft than it normally would be. I considered trying the R1 exit; however; the firemen wanted us to continue out L1. They had pulled the bottom of the slide away from the aircraft so that the gradient wasn't as steep; directed us to sit at the top of the slide and use the hand straps in the center of the slide about a foot below the level of the door to lower ourselves onto the slide; and then ride the slide down with them in position to catch us. I elected to follow their guidance and was the next to evacuate. The jumpseaters followed me. While the jumpseaters evacuated I checked on the FO who was still not being attended to. He told me that when his feet contacted the taxiway his face impacted his knees and he felt like his back was injured. I would say it took the EMTs approximately 10-15 minutes to respond; attend to his injuries; and transport him to the hospital. One other point; until the EMTs arrived; the jumpseaters did their best to attend to the FO including trying to keep him warm. He was lying on the concrete in his uniform leather jacket in freezing temperatures and physically started shivering before somebody broke out a blanket to cover him with. After the evacuation of the aircraft all I can say is that I think it should have been handled better by the Fire Department. I briefed them that we had indications of deployment of the FSS into the ADG contra with no other fire or smoke indications; and gave them our copy of the Dangerous Goods Summary (the Dangerous Goods Manifest was still on the flight deck).  I assumed their first priority would be to board the aircraft and determine the status of the container. Instead; I was asked if maintenance or myself were going to ride the brakes on the flight deck so the aircraft could be towed to the operation ramp and they could re-open the taxiway. I politely told them that wasn't going to happen until we determined the status of the ADG container at 1R. I gathered from our conversation that they were unfamiliar with the location of 1R and how to access the main cargo deck through the courier compartment. Soon after the evacuation and after my initial conversations with the FO and the Fire Captain the jumpseaters asked me to look at the L1 slide. The top side of the slide looked somewhat normal; however; all of the vertical and horizontal support chambers on the bottom side of the slide were either not inflated or partially inflated at best. When the Fire Department procured some stairs; I led them on board through the L1 door; opened the cargo deck access door and pointed them to the ADG container. They opened the container and determined that the FSS had deployed into the ADG container; however; they saw no residual fire or smoke indications. I grabbed the Dangerous Goods Manifest on the flight deck and gave it to the Fire Captain which he returned to me later. The Fire Captain then released the aircraft to maintenance who detached the slide and towed the aircraft to the Ramp.  Throughout this event I had multiple phone conversations with the Duty Officer to keep him in the loop and to determine the status of the FO at the hospital. After arriving at the Ramp Office I made two entries in the Aircraft Maintenance Log (AML): The in-flight FSS deployment and the failure of the L1 Door Evacuation Slide to properly deploy. On a final note; I would like to commend the performance of First Officer. I wasn't keeping track but one of the jumpseaters informed me it was 14 minutes from FSS activation to evacuation. Suffice it to say that I did the easy part and flew the jet; while he backed me up and did everything else to get us safely on the deck and out the door.The Fire Suppression System (FSS) deployed into the Accessible Dangerous Goods (ADG) container at Pos 1R with no post-flight inspection indications of fire or smoke. The Evacuation Slide in the L1 Door did not deploy properly. See the Please Describe What Happened narrative for more detail.",,"I was one of two jumpseaters. I was awakened in flight by what sounded like a door falling off one of the freight cans in the back of the airplane. Shortly thereafter; the Captain (also jumpseating) informed the crew via hand mic that the Fire Suppression System had activated and indicated 'red' for position 1C and 1R. The Captain and I each checked the cargo bay visually through the window in the small cargo access door; but did not see any smoke. I returned to my seat and remained there until the Captain ordered the evacuation of the aircraft. Evacuation - it appeared that the slide did not completely inflate until the fire crew pulled on the slide from the ground at which time the First Officer exited the aircraft. It appeared as though the slide 'buckled' in the center and the First Officer came to an abrupt stop at the bottom and rolled off the corner of the slide in obvious pain. He remained on the concrete. The Captain and ground crew were determining options at that point and fire crew assured the Captain they had a crew of firefighters securing the slide and the Captain evacuated. Still uncertain as to probability of successfully using the slide (Captain is a smaller and lighter man than I) I was considering using the other slide; convinced by the rescue crew that they would keep slide from collapsing; I hung onto door sill as instructed to shorten the slide/ fall as much as possible and evacuated. I immediately went to attend to the First Officer as he was laying on the concrete unattended. I gave him my gloves and put my cap under his head and talked to him until the fire crew provided some blankets and got a backboard under him to get him off the cold concrete. Once the ambulance arrived; Captain and I sat in one of the Airport ops vehicles until being transported up the 'Kilo' taxiway to the ramp facility.",,"A flight crew elected to divert to the closest suitable airport after the Fire Suppression System deployed into the Accessible Dangerous Goods container.

I asked Mr. X to buckle his seatbelt and that is when his wife; Mrs. X; seated in XXE; advised me that Mr. X suffered from dementia. I proceeded to assist Mr. X and buckled his seatbelt around him. While completing our safety checks for landing; I noticed that Mr. X did not have his seatbelt fastened. I again asked Mr. X to buckle up for landing. He was not complying; so I assisted Mr. X by buckling his seatbelt for him. I proceeded to my jumpseat and buckled in. While seated I had heard the noises of a seatbelt being unbuckled. I turned around and looked up the aisle toward the forward part of the aircraft and noticed that Mr. X had his seatbelt unbuckled and hanging in the aisle. I proceeded to get up and inform Mr. X that his seatbelt need to be fastened for landing. He made some unrecognizable noises and words and proceeded to stand up and enter the aisle of the aircraft. I advised Mr. X that he needed to seated for landing. There was a lady passenger seated in front of him in XYD that had an infant attached to her in a Baby Bjorn type of harness. Mr. X proceeded to attempt to grab the child by placing his hands under each of the infants' arms. The pax in XYD was in complete shock. I tried to get Mr. X to release the child. Once I did so; Mr. X continued to stay in the aisle of the aircraft when I heard the landing gear deploy. Once again; I asked Mr. X to take his seat for landing and he continued to stand in the aisle. The following happened in order: Mr. X refused to listen to our orders to sit down in his seat for landing.Mr. X became slightly combative with the female passenger seated in XXC who was trying to help. Mr. X grabbed her right wrist tightly causing discomfort and pain. Once xx; FA in the back with me; and I realized how close we were to the ground due to fog; we had to stay standing in the aisle to protect Mr. X. I proceeded to try and get around Mr. X to make sure I was standing in front of him to protect him from lurching forward once we touched down on the runway. FA xx stayed the back to make sure Mr. X did not fall backwards. While going around Mr. X; he pushed his backside against me and pushed me into the passenger seated at XYC. He then yelled at me telling me I was an 'xx hole.' I repeatedly told Mr. X that 'I am here for your safety!! I am here for your safety!!'XX notified the Purser of the situation once we had landed. Purser XX then relayed the information to the flight deck crew. Mr. X continued to walk around the back cabin and aft galley as we taxied in and xx blocked the doors preventing Mr. X from trying to open the doors while they were armed.

I was uncomfortable with this and afraid for my own safety should we have had an event such as an unplanned evacuation or even an aborted takeoff and these unsecured objects came flying at my head. I also feel that the use of electronic devices by those in the exit row could delay their ability to assist in an emergency due to distraction. During taxi; one of the customers across from me had reclined his seat as we had been on the tarmac for a while. I had to physically get up from my jumpseat and tap him on the shoulder to remind him to put his seatback up; as he was so engrossed in his tablet that he didn't hear or see me try to get his attention. I was sitting literally two feet away from him-directly in front of his seat; and he didn't notice me for about 2 minutes. Our announcement book addresses electronics only by saying that they can be used in airplane safe mode; but must be 'secured or held during taxi; takeoff and landing'; therefore I could not require these customers to stow the tablets in a seat pocket (on sidewall of aircraft) or in an overhead (OH) bin; as they were complying with [Airline's] policy of being 'held.' Also; since use of the devices is allowed; even in exit rows where people are supposed to be 'ready; willing and able' to assist; I cannot ask a customer in an exit row to turn off their device. However; our requirement has always been (and still remains) that ALL items must go in OH bin if one is seated at a bulkhead--which the seats across from 2L/2R as well as 3L/3R are. Therefore; customers are being 'allowed' to have potentially dangerous items out during critical phases of flight; with the potential to harm the crewmembers sitting directly in front of them- I believe in violation of our own and possibly FAA policies. The safety training that I have received from my company has always emphasized that no carry-on items can be out and 'un' stowed during taxi/takeoff/landing due to the potential harm they could cause if the aircraft should stop suddenly. Yet since the implementation of the new electronics policy; these devices; made of metal and glass; cease to be 'carry-on items' and seem to have been made exempt from all safety concerns; regardless of their potential ability to harm their owners or others. Customers using electronic devices at exit rows and who are required to be 'ready willing and able' to assist in case of emergency; are also distracted by their own electronic devices during critical phases of flight. I am very uncomfortable with the way the electronics policies have been rushed into implementation with seemingly no regard to the safety of other people who could be harmed by flying tablets and phones; as well as the implications of a 'plugged in and switched off' person at an exit row who is too distracted to perform their exit row emergency duties in a thorough or timely fashion.",,,,"Flight Attendant reported concern that she could be injured by unsecured tablets or other electronic devices used by passengers sitting across from her jumpseat if those passengers lost control of the device during a rejected takeoff or other unusual event.",

The weight and height of the bins cause injuries and long term back and shoulder problems. These bins often come open during the takeoff and landing of the flight due to the difficulty with the closing of the bins. I was hurt in 2009 and wrote to [my airline]; AFA; OSHA and the FAA. I would like to have this problem addressed to prevent injuries. [My airline] wants to prevent injuries but will not address this serious problem. It is not in my job description to be able to lift 75-150 lbs over my head into a 6 foot high ceiling. I am 5 ft. 2 inches and when I was hired you could not be 6 feet tall with or without high heel shoes. Most of the flight attendants that I fly with have this height and are not able to lift these weights.

I made a few other calls to other airmen in my traffic pattern to sequence; and clear while simultaneously receiving a call from another Helicopter Y on the ground at the FBO. I did not have a departure strip for helicopter Y and coordinated with ground to give helicopter Y taxi instructions to my runway for intersection departure. I observed Helicopter X on right downwind; as instructed passing the midpoint of the runway. During all of this I was also receiving a coordination request verbally from the other local controller beside me regarding inbound instructions to other arrivals outside of the airspace. Later Helicopter X reported on right base runway 30 and was promptly instructed to turn back to the downwind and extend. The pilot read back the instruction and I observed Helicopter X on a base heading in a left turn back to the downwind. I continued sequencing and clearing other aircraft in the pattern and as I was making one transmission to another airmen I lost sight of Helicopter X; on the extended right downwind; behind two controllers in the tower cab conducting a position relief briefing at the Operational Supervisor in Charge desk. I stood up to regain sight of Helicopter X flying directly through the final approach course for runway 30; approximately 1 mile final. There was already a C172; approaching 1 mile final cleared for runway 30. Helicopter X appeared disoriented and was flying very fast for the phase of flight they were in (VFR traffic pattern). I sent Cessna around and asked Helicopter X if they had the airport environment in sight. The pilot responded in the affirmative and I instructed them to turn around and intercept final for runway 30. At that time the pilot reported a NMAC with the fixed wing (Cessna). Helicopter X continued on a south heading through final and now approaching the opposite downwind. I issued a suggested heading to fly to Helicopter X to reorient the pilot on the opposite downwind and the pilot read it back. I then issued a sequence number 2 and pointed out traffic on base to final; another Cessna; to follow. I observed Helicopter X now on an easterly heading approaching final for runway 30; opposite direction again. I asked the pilot his heading; he read back an easterly heading that was 35 degrees off from what I had suggested. At that point I made the decision to make Helicopter X #1 to the runway and climb the two Cessna's I had originally planned for Helicopter X to follow on final above pattern altitude to overfly the runway. I coordinated with ground for the taxi route of Helicopter X to legend and issued instructions to Helicopter X to taxi to the FBO after landing. I asked Helicopter X if he was familiar and the pilot responded in the affirmative.Runway 30/12 operations at this airport are already faced with many obstructions to views causing difficulties for controllers. Although the runway is visible; aircraft holding short of the runway are blocked by a building. There is a CCTV (Closed-circuit Television) camera that faces this blind spot but it has been a black screen in the tower cab (OTS) for almost a full year. Radar coverage is very poor SW of the airport and that is typically where the fixed wing traffic pattern/inbounds are on runway 30/12 ops. On this particular day; the radar was a black screen due to a widespread outage. There are antennas that protrude through the visual scan of the runway from the perspective of the tower cab. The tower cab position configuration puts the CIC; FD; CD; and GC all in-between the LC1 controller and runway 12/30 creating obstructions to view when controllers stand (position relief; making the ATIS; people walking up the stairs into the tower cab; not enough chairs; etc.)I would recommend that all controllers be aware of the distraction that simply entering the operations area (especially a smallVFR tower) and relieving another controller may create; and to act accordingly to minimize the negative impact to the controllers on position.",,"I was working Local Assist at the time of the incident. There was a CIC/Operational Supervisor in Charge position relief briefing happening. I do not know if they were an obstruction of view for the LC1 position. When on RWY 30 the local controller views out the window towards the CIC position in the tower. We were working an inner/outer configuration with our two local controllers. At about XA30L that day we lost all radar; landlines; phone lines; and internet capability. Approach also was limited to only one frequency in there whole facility. I recall when Helicopter X checked in with LC1 he was instructed to proceed direct to the tower and enter a right downwind for RWY 30. The pilot acknowledged. His next call was turning base. Cessna was on 1.5-2 mile final for RWY 30 at this time; LC1 told Helicopter X to extend downwind and turn left. A few seconds later I observed Helicopter X not making the turn and still heading towards final at Cessna. I told the LC1 he was heading at the Cessna on final. Helicopter X then gave him an instruction to turn right 180 to re-intercept final. The helicopter reported a NMAC and LC1 sent Cessna around. Cessna reported the helicopter intercepted final. LC1 then issued a suggested heading of 120 to put the helicopter on the left downwind. There was another Cessna on final that was issued to climb to 065 to get out of the way of the helicopter attempting to rejoin final.Everything that day was a mess due to the loss of all the equipment and radar. We were unable to use the radar as an aid to assist in finding aircraft entering the class Delta airspace. Helicopter X took base early and after told to remain on downwind still headed towards the final corridor. Had he taken the left turn and remained on downwind the NMAC would have never happened.",,"Two Tower controllers and a Helicopter pilot describe a near miss at a busy airport where communications and radar were hampered by outages.",

I found no flight plan in the system; Flight Service said he'd call back.  A few minutes later he called; just as the flight plan populated in EDST; from RWL; Rawlins Airport via direct TOMSN.TOMSN6.ZZZ.  I issued clearance from Rawlins to ZZZ; with 'climb and maintain 170; expect FL250 five minutes after departure' and a clearance void time; if not off by XX00 to advise not later that XX+05 of intentions.  I don't remember the beacon code offhand.Not long afterward I noticed a XXYY code pop up in Salt Lake Center's airspace; climbing and appearing to come towards my sector from Worland Airport; WRL.  Nothing in EDST matched an airplane coming from there; but the code matched the present assignment to [last three of previous discussed aircraft]; whose track I had created over RWL to wait for the departure.  At this point it occurred to me that somebody might have confused RWL and WRL; just as Salt Lake initiated handoff and the track over RWL auto-acquired onto the handoff aircraft.  At this point I called Salt Lake to inquire if the aircraft really were Aircraft X; and; if so; how he had checked on with the sector.  I was told it was [same last three numbers]; he couldn't get Denver Center on the assigned frequency (132.1; the departure frequency I had assigned for the clearance out of RWL); so he had gone to the Salt Lake frequency and checked on looking for clearance.  The Salt Lake controller had issued clearance; believing the aircraft to be the usual VFR departure picking up an IFR clearance; and was not aware of any other issues in regard to the aircraft.When the [last three as the previous filed aircraft] checked on I was able to determine that he had received clearance through Oakland Flight Service; but had not been able to reach Denver Center and so went over to the Salt Lake Center frequency.  This pilot is experienced and familiar with the area.The most serious immediate problem is that this aircraft departed believing he was operating IFR out of an airport where the responsible controller had no knowledge of the operation; with all the potential risk that entails.  It is clear something in the communication between the pilot and Flight Service did not meet standards; and that the Oakland Flight Service Station had no familiarity with the airports or airspace for which he was requesting authorization for IFR operations.It is difficult to know how address readback errors; to which category these events clearly belong; other than with education.  There appears to be a certain deficiency in the Flight Service Station's operation; particularly with respect to familiarity with the area of responsibility.",,"After Engine Start at WRL; Worland WY; attempted to call Seattle Center on the ground at WRL; we had no response after several attempts.  Therefore; I called FSS on my cell phone to obtain our clearance and release.  FSS stated they had no flight plan on file so the briefer offered to file one for us which he did.  He returned with a clearance and release which included the instructions to contact Denver Center on 132.1 after departure.  We accepted the clearance and departed WRL and attempted Denver Center without success so switched to Salt Lake as published on the instrument chart and as we had used going into WRL the day before.  That attempt was successful and it seemed apparent that Salt Lake was expecting us.  We were immediately in radar contact and they gave us a transponder code different from what our clearance had been.Our IFR flight plan had been filed via FltPlan.com who reported back to us that the flight plan had been submitted and filed; WRL to ZZZ.Subsequently in conversation with Denver Center; it seemed there was confusion about our flight plan.  Our speculation is that; for whatever reason; background noise in the cockpit from the engines; poor cell phone reception; unfamiliarity with the area; the FSS briefer mistook my communication and perhaps thought we were departing out of Rawlins WY; RLW; and didn't understand or misinterpreted my statement we were departing out of Worland; WRL.Our question and confusion is I was under the impression that if a flight plan had been filed by aircraft tail number that tail number would show up and display whatever flight plan was filed under that tail number.  Our concern or misunderstanding is that when we called FSS; 15 minutes after the flight plan had been filed by FltPlan; it didn't show up in the system and wasn't visible to FSS.",,"A ZDV Controller and pilot report confusion after the aircraft departs IFR at one airport while the Controller was waiting for the aircraft to depart off of a different airport.

The controller issued the landing information and told the aircraft to expect the Visual Approach RWY 17 at VCV. The controller then informed the aircraft that VCV airport was 12 o'clock 18 miles. The controller did not inform the aircraft of APV airport which was 1 o'clock and 8 miles. The pilot stated it was hazy and he would report the airport in sight. He subsequently reported the airport in sight and the controller cleared him for a visual approach Runway 17. Shortly after that the aircraft was issued a communication change to VCV airport. A little while later the low altitude alert went off for Aircraft X. Aircraft X was approximately 15 miles east of the VCV airport at 5700. The controller silenced the low altitude alert as the aircraft left 5;500 MSL and continued to monitor the situation. The MVA for that area 6;500. When the controller noticed Aircraft X turning final to APV airport he called the tower and asked if everything was ok with Aircraft X it appears he was lined up to APV airport. The tower responded they would ask.  The aircraft went into coast status briefly and was observed at 3;400 MSL. The field elevation is 3;062. Tower eventually issued a 300 heading and a climb to 6;000. I asked the tower to have the pilot call the facility.  The pilot called and said it was hazy and he had a new First Officer. He stated he had flown into VCV before and he was helping the First Officer fly the airplane and descend and he got the wrong airport. He asked if there was going to be any punishment; I said not that I was aware of; I wanted to understand what had happened. I said he might want to file ASAP. I also asked the controller if he has issued APV 1 o'clock and 10 miles and VCV 12 o'clock and 18 miles and he said he did not. Another controller said they were not aware of that phraseology. Recommendations: refer this event to the LSC [training department] and have them create a lessons learned/ best practice to share with the facility. We have two sets of airports that are located 10 miles from each other. The 7110.65 Paragraph 7-4-3g just says 'in those instances where airports are located in close proximity; also provide the location of the airport that may cause the confusion.' it is vague as to what constitutes close proximity. The controller used his judgement; but never issued the low altitude alert to the tower; or provided positive control instructions for the tower to issue.",,"I was Pilot Flying [PF] Aircraft X. Normal in-range checklist was completed; including a briefing of intended runway (17) and type of approach for intended runway (visual backed-up by the ILS). ATC cleared flight from cruise altitude down to 13;000 and subsequently down to 10;000. Thereafter; pilot monitoring [PM] and PF were queried regarding whether airport was in sight and we both agreed we had it; which was approximately 12 o'clock and approximately 8 miles (based on my recollection of visually identifying the airport and confirming it with the MFD).  ATC then cleared Aircraft X to land. I began maneuvering the aircraft for a downwind leg; while continuing to configure aircraft for landing. After turning from base to final; PM notified me that the LOC had not captured and called for a go-around. As I called for TOGA (Takeoff/Go-around) thrust and Flaps 8; my scan moved to the top of the PFD and I noticed that the FMA did not change to LOC. As I continued my scan upward and outside of the aircraft; I caught a glimpse of the number on the runway prior to losing it under the nose of the aircraft and noticed it was for runway 18. Around this time; ATC queried Aircraft X as to intentions and status. PF replied (to which I don't remember the specifics) while I continued flying the aircraft. I leveled aircraft at 5;000 and after discussing with PF; navigated aircraft to VCV. Approach and landing thereafter was uneventful.In reviewing the sequence of events and all of the specifics surrounding what took place; it quickly became evident that we had mistaken (what was later determined to be) Apple Valley Airport (APV) for Victorville Airport (VCV). In reviewing the applicable charts and plates; I mistook APV for VCV based on the geographic location; runway layout and runway orientation. Further research showed that APV is approximately 8 miles directly east of VCV; that both VCV and APV have rising terrain/mountains directly east of the airport; that APV has intersecting runways like VCV and the longer runway of the two has an 18 orientation; while VCV's longest runway has a 17 orientation. Further contributing to this was the fact that this was the first time I was sequenced into VCV from the south; as my previous trips into the airport were from the north and nowhere near APV.I take full and complete responsibility for the events that took place. As the PF; I maneuvered the aircraft toward the runway after calling it in sight. With that; the PF and I had great CRM throughout the entire flight and the error in our decision making was trapped; identified and eliminated by backing up the visual with the ILS.In regards to avoiding the recurrence of this event; in recollecting what happened; I now remember that I had my MFDU set on a 5 mile ring. Had I lower the ring to 2.5; I believe I would have been alerted to the difference between the distance denoted on the MFDU and what I believe to be APV; given the actual distance between the two airports. In addition; I am also considering carrying a small pair of binoculars to use in helping to visually confirm airports when flying in the future. I will also conduct a more thorough review of airports and other items of significance around my arrival airport to help give me even a better idea of what to expect prior to flight.",,"E10 Front Line Manager; Controller; and pilot report of not seeing the correct airport and lining up for another airport incorrectly.

[I had] received an email from either the Chief Pilot or the maintenance controller stating something about that Embraer had delivered our aircraft to us; and they believed the rudder gust lock couldn't be engaged and that the crew should defer the rudder gust lock before departure.  I called the Maintenance controller and he mentioned something about sending in the MEL 'and we'll have you guys on your way.' I walked out to the aircraft and quickly assessed the gust lock situation. Sure enough; the gust lock pin was installed and the rudder pedals were not locked. Now please note that part of my routine as for my personal pre flight procedures; I wait until my pre flight is complete before calling maintenance control with any and all issues found. So now I am aware of the gust lock situation and I continue my pre flight. The next issue I find is an expired Mexican authorization form that is required for our flight into Mexico. So my first call is to the Chief Pilot; and it goes from there to what seemed like dozens of folks from almost every other department to get some info. I even had my chief pilot on the phone regarding this. Suffice it to say I was very focused on this issue. I've heard bad things about Mexican jails and I didn't want to have any first hand experiences. Finally; the problem [was] solved with the Mexican forms. I then sent in the MEL concerning the Gust lock. In short order I received the typical deferral message from maintenance with all of the usual information including a bar code indicating to me; a proper maintenance deferral.  With all that had been going on earlier and our departure time looming; and remembering the Maintenance controller saying what he did; I put researching the MEL at the back of my mind and subsequently forgot to do so. Yesterday I received an email and then a phone call advising me that there is an issue with that MEL submission. From that notification I learned that a maintenance procedure was required to make that MEL legal and correct. I looked up the MEL for myself and sure enough; there it was. Obviously the maintenance procedure was not completed before departure.I blame no one for my mistakes and or oversights. [I need to] #1; slow down.  #2; Stay focused. #3; don't stress. I [failed] all [three of those] that morning. Again; I blame myself. HOWEVER; I would like to mention now that lately; life on the road is more demanding than ever. There seemed to be a time when the crews had time to meet the demands of the day. And there seemed to be a time when the other departments did their jobs correctly and in a timely fashion. Now; I feel the opposite is true. There is more duty during the day with what seems like less time to do them. Less personnel [at headquarters] to help. Things are left undone only to let the crews figure it out for themselves. There's a feeling among the crews is that headquarters doesn't care about the crew lately. It doesn't matter how true it is; the fact of the matter is; that's the sentiment. The Mexican forms issue I had to deal with. Really? Was that necessary? How many times throughout the week do crews find this (sort of thing) and [have to] call HQ to resolve this? There could have been a temporary letter in the special binder in front of the expired document to offer some guidance. But no. One more thing I have to find; and figure out. 20 more people to call.

The Captain was required with no ops advisory guidance to execute a maneuver that is virtually never trained or practiced in very challenging deteriorating conditions. Adding to the challenge the wind sheared from a headwind to crosswind on final approach. A go around on the base leg of the circle would have been highly inadvisable due to terrain. The shifting wind certainly contributed to the pod clearance issue on touchdown.I have spent very little of my 'career' with [my current airline] but in the short time I have been trained [here] there has been no information (as in zero; zilch; nada) or training or guidance regarding PAN OPS versus TERPS circling criteria. I attempted a mini tutorial on the subject during the descent but the last thing a new Captain needs is a flunky know-it-all First Officer trying to explain that the approach in MHRO is designed by a different regulatory body than the FAA and has different criteria. I know if I were him I would have ignored me.

As we approached centerline of the track we started experience moderate wake turbulence from the aircraft approximated 15NM ahead of us and 1000 feet above us.  I called to return to the offset; recognizing the turbulence was caused by the preceding aircraft's wake.  The pilot flying was slow to get back to the offset (seconds) as he attempted to return to the 2R offset by entering it in the FMS.  The turbulence was great enough that as pilot monitoring I aided the pilot flying by selecting a 15-20 degree heading change back to the offset the pilot flying entered in the FMS.  The wake turbulence caused the plane to start to climb.  The plane may have corrected back on its own if left alone; but the pilot flying initiated a descent with the vertical speed wheel passing about 100 feet high.  The plane continued to climb as the autopilot was slow (milliseconds) to the vertical speed input.  The pilot flying then hit an altitude hold followed by another vertical speed descent input; which arrested the climb.   We topped out approximate 410 feet high from our assigned altitude of FL290.  The time from altitude deviation due to wake turbulence and back down to FL290 was less than 10 seconds.  We could not have reacted quicker.  The preceding aircraft was approximately 15 miles ahead of us.  No TCAS TAs or RAs.

I refueled and the immediately adjacent runway - 26 - was favorable for my intended direction of travel; and to the best of my recollection it was favored by light winds from the NW.  I also was considering the training helicopter activity on the ramp and the 26 departure put me on the runway quickly; allowing me to expedite my departure from the busy training environment.  I heard other aircraft inbound; but they were a comfortable distance out.  I saw no traffic creating a conflict for a 26 departure.  I announced a 26 departure.  As I was climbing out; I noticed a R44 helicopter at the west end of 26; blades turning; sitting on the ground.  It was not close call.  I routinely have closer interactions using the taxiway at my home airport with training helicopters in the pattern.  The R44 was on the ground at the time and I had substantial altitude.  A minute or so later; I heard the R44 pilot announce a movement.  Knowing then that the pilot was on CTAF; I asked the pilot why he had not said something on the radio when I announced I was using 26.  He replied the runway was closed.  He was correct; and when he said that; I in fact recalled the NOTAM.  Nothing on the AWOS or on the ground prior to 26 entry indicated closure.  The runway was in fine condition from what I could see.  I do not agree that a runway being NOTAMed closed suggests that one then shouldn't use the radio to tell someone where you are at or better; point out the closure.  Factors affecting my decision making include not rechecking NOTAMs prior to takeoff and wanting to quickly leave the training environment and continue my x-country flight.

The runway in use at Prescott was Runway 30 with the winds out of the north with gusts to 22kt; and visibility greater than 10SM.  We had been cleared for a touch and go on 30 from the left downwind.  Sometime before turning base tower gave right traffic entry instructions for a helicopter that was approaching the airport from the east (I do not recall the exact instructions that were giving to the helicopter).  Soon after we turned on an approximately 2.5NM final I heard the helicopter report right base.  The helicopter did not give a distance out; and tower told him to turn back to the right downwind.  This caught my attention and I begin to scan for traffic off the right wing tip; and behind the wing.  This was where I determined that helicopter would be according to their radio calls.  I checked the MFD for any ADS-B traffic; but due to a radar outage any non-ADS-B equipped aircraft would not show on the MFD.  The student continued to fly down final. When we were on an approximately 1.5NM final I turned my attention back to our final approach course; as I was unable to locate the helicopter off my right side.  I located the helicopter shortly after looking back at final.  We were still about 1.5NM out and approximately 500 feet AGL.  The helicopter was at our one o'clock and headed straight for us (approximately 150 feet lateral and -100 feet vertical).  I took evasive action by pulling hard on the elevator and banking to the left to avoid sudden impact with the helicopter.  My best guess is we were 3 seconds from impact.  I continued to climb to TPA on runway heading.  My student never saw the helicopter.The helicopter pilot then reported to tower that he had a near mid air; I responded that he had just crossed the final approach course.  Tower then had him turn back to the right downwind for 30.Other contributing factors were that Prescott tower's radar feed was also out of service; which left the tower without a valuable aid in sequencing aircraft arrivals.  This coupled with the fact the helicopter was a transient aircraft that may have not been adequately familiar with the area.",,,,"C172 instructor pilot reported an NMAC with a helicopter at PRC during a time the Tower's radar was out of service.",

I believe this was the result of a trainee controller who could not handle all of the aircraft. He did not manage speed of the various aircraft and several times vectored aircraft off the approach course due to conflicts.Returning from a trip VFR; I found that my home field CCR was under a marine layer. I obtained an IFR clearance and started the procedure at REJOY. The controller told me that because of multiple aircraft; he'd probably put me in a box pattern somewhere; meaning vectors around an undefined area.  I've been through this before with this TRACON. Have they never heard of asking someone to hold at a fix? Because they are vectoring aircraft in circles; they get overwhelmed quickly. I asked if I could expect to intercept the final approach course on the turn around the circle (having had them screw that up the last two times) and was told to expect that.After the 360; I was approaching the final approach course. He hadn't cleared me yet; but they usually say to 'track inbound.'  However; at the last second; and just as the autopilot started to intercept; the controller came on and said for me to fly a different heading on the other side of the FAC. The controller had given me no warning that he would in fact not clear me to intercept the course. I questioned this and he apologized. He then reversed himself and told me to turn back to intercept the course and cleared me for the approach.I got established; hit the FAF which was right at the top of the layer and beginning a descent; when I noticed on TCAS an aircraft that was about 1 mile in front and 200 feet above. I called the controller and asked about the traffic and he said; 'uh; Aircraft X; yeah; uh; approach clearance cancelled; turn left to 030.' I admit to getting really angry and said: 'Excuse me; but now you're making me circle a second time? That's just going to waste a lot of fuel. I'm just trying to understand where he's going and whether I can continue the approach.'    To which the controller then said OK; you're cleared for the approach; which I confirmed. However; by this time I was getting behind; was in the soup; still looking at the TCAS and realized I was way above the glideslope. I'm not sure but think the approach didn't capture because I got vectored back inside the FAF. So; I ended up going missed. Soon thereafter someone clearly more experienced came on and got me back around.The TRACON needs to develop better procedures for its trainees. It is not sequencing traffic into approaches; but rather sending pilots on multiple vectors to try to manage the situation. They are not providing any warning when approaching the final approach course as to whether we will be cleared to intercept. This is particularly problematic on a coupled approach where the autopilot captures the course and then the pilot has to disengage it or switch to heading mode. That's not a good time to be making those distracting changes.I did call the TRACON to ask a supervisor to review the tapes and was promised a return phone call but none was forthcoming.",,,,"Pilot reports of poor service with Travis TRACON on multiple times and especially on the trip reported.",

I was working Ground Control. Northern California TRACON requested opposite direction for Aircraft Y to Rwy 34R. Aircraft X was on final to Rwy 16L sequenced number one to the runway. It appeared from the outset that it would be close to newly determined cutoff point for ODO to the same runway. Local controller discussed situation with me and we had decided that if Aircraft Y needed to be redirected to Rwy 16L/R we would be advised by the arrival sector. Aircraft X was on short final (less than 1/2 mile) when Aircraft Y checked in at about a 13 mile final. New cutoff requirements had gone into effect that required the second aircraft to be at 15 miles or greater when the first aircraft crossed the threshold. The procedure as set up is sufficient for the operation. I now think that it would have been appropriate for me to call the supervisor or the local controller to advise the arrival sector that Aircraft Y needed to be broken off the approach and redirected to the runway in use. As written; there is the implication in the LOA that in this case the arrival/coordinating sector would advise us to break out the aircraft; just as they would be expected to do if we had compression to the runway in use and it appeared that there would be a loss. I don't know that specifying the responsibility more clearly would solve this issue.",,"I was working LC (south wind landing RWYs 16) and the approach controller (from here on; I will refer to them by their facility name 'NCT') called me to coordinate an opposite direction arrival for Aircraft Y sixty miles to the southeast landing RWY 34R. I quickly checked our departures and approved the request; as no departures would prohibit this. As Aircraft Y got closer to the airport; I noticed to the north that Aircraft X was the same distance from the airport inbound for the same runway but opposite direction (RWY 16L). Following him about 5-10 miles in-trail was Aircraft Z inbound for RWY 16R. And finally Aircraft A was inbound from the south to RWY 16L.According to the national ODO (Opposite Direction Operation) requirements as well as our LOA with NCT; there were three separation issues. The LOA states that NCT must ensure that an arrival must be on the ground by the time the same runway opposite direction arrival reaches 15 miles from the airport. To parallel runways; NCT must ensure standard or visual separation is being used between the arrivals. Aircraft X was the first to land on RWY 16L. When he touched down; Aircraft Y was around 11-12 mile final; opposite direction for RWY 34R. NCT didn't have 15 miles. Then as Aircraft Y was on final Aircraft Z was on the reciprocal final landing RWY 16R. I don't know what kind of separation was being used; because I didn't get Aircraft Y in sight until he was about 5 mile final (and Aircraft Z was about 4 mile final at that point.) I had been talking to both of these arrivals outside of 10 mile finals for their perspective runways. With the cloud layers; there's no way NCT was able to get pilot visual separation when they were over 20 miles apart; as I got them when they were about 8-9 miles apart. NCT didn't ask me to provide any kind of visual separation; and they ended up with about 1.5-2 miles lateral separation as they landed. They might have assumed that I was going to provide visual separation (which I was able to do before they lost standard IFR separation) but they didn't ensure anything. Finally; by the time Aircraft Y landed RWY 34R; Aircraft A was turning final for 16L (needing 15 miles; again) but was within 10 miles when Aircraft Y touched down. I don't know if it's a lack of/poor briefing at NCT; or a misunderstanding of the rules by the controllers; but almost nothing was properly handled in this instance. And if it was a misunderstanding of the rules; the controllers shouldn't be using the procedure.",,"SMF Front Line Manager and Local Controller report of an Opposite Direction Operation (ODO) that resulted in a loss of required ODO separation.",

I told the CPC-IT that even though we issue the climb via clearance we still need to make sure they comply with the altitudes. I saw Aircraft X climbing out of 3;400 at a normal rate.

She had 4 aircraft doing multiple RNAV Approaches to 34L at PAE; in addition to multiple aircraft being vectored for approaches at other airports; aircraft picking up IFR clearances from uncontrolled airports; aircraft holding; and PAE Tower requesting IFR releases. PAE was IFR. When we took position; Aircraft X was on final for the RNAV 34L; talking to PAE Tower. His missed approach instructions were 'fly heading 250; maintain 2;000'; as per our LOA with PAE Tower. She vectored Aircraft Y to the RNAV 34L to follow Aircraft X. When Aircraft Y was established on final; he was 6 miles behind Aircraft X; with little to no overtake. She issued Aircraft Y missed approach instructions of heading 250; maintain 2000 (again; as per our LOA with PAE Tower). Aircraft X dropped off radar and stayed 'in the hole' for some time. When he tagged back up and checked in; he didn't appear to be tracking a 250 heading; and his check-in was broken. My trainee said; 'Verify heading 250.' Aircraft X responded; 'heading 250.' Aircraft Y then went missed at what appeared to be the missed approach point; right at the approach end of the runway. PAE Tower allowed him to turn to the 250 heading and shipped him to our frequency; but this was a conflict with Aircraft X; who was also on a 250 heading. I was about to key up to take corrective action; but my trainee recognized the conflict immediately and turned Aircraft X 30 degrees left in order to establish divergence. The time between when separation was lost and the time divergence was established was exactly 5 seconds. At the time; I wasn't sure that separation had actually been lost because Aircraft Y was still in a turn from the 340 heading to the 250 heading when he checked in; and my trainee's timely corrective action may have saved it. In any event; it was my understanding that PAE Tower should have given those aircraft to us with separation; so if a loss of standard separation happened; it was on the PAE Tower Controller. We continued working with no other issues throughout the rest of the session; and I never gave it another thought.On [date removed] my supervisor asked me if I remembered a busy session from a couple weeks ago; in which I felt the sectors should have been de-combined. I had no idea what he was talking about and asked if something had happened. He said he didn't know. I was curious; so I went to talk to our facility QA (Quality Assurance) person. I asked him if something happened that I was involved in from [the specified date]; and he said; 'Yes; nobody has told you yet?' he explained to me the scenario; and I immediately knew what he was talking about. I said; 'Well; that's PAE Tower's responsibility; right? So it's on them?' he said that's what he thought; but upper management didn't see it that way; and it's on us. I discussed the scenario with him for a long time and explained my reasoning; quoting our LOA with PAE Tower; as well as the 7110.65. He told me that he 100% agreed with me; but that management thinks we should have either provided PAE with more separation with the two aircraft; or we should have issued diverging missed approach instructions. I quoted our LOA with PAE Tower: 5-b (8) 'PAE ATCT is delegated a) the responsibility to provide initial IFR or visual separation between PAE arrivals and departures and b) the responsibility to provide initial IFR separation between successive PAE departures.' I also quoted the 7110.65 3-8-2: 'consider an aircraft cleared for touch-and-go; stop-and-go; or low approach as an arriving aircraft until it touches down (for touch-and-go); or makes a complete stop (for stop-and-go); or crossing the landing threshold (for low approach); and thereafter as a departing aircraft.'I argued that this means that both aircraft on the missed approach; as defined by the 7110; are considered departures; and PAE Tower; as stipulated in our LOA; is responsible for separating departures. He said that he argued all of this to management; but they would not budge. They still believed it was my fault. I said that we gave PAE Tower two times what standard separation requires of us; and asked how much spacing I should be expected to afford; when I have no way of knowing whether the first aircraft will be stop and go; touch and go; or how long he'll take to execute his missed. He said he asked our facility manager this question; and the manager responded that it's not about miles; it's about preparing for any possible thing to happen; and that we shouldn't place so much expectation on PAE Tower controllers. I don't understand what rule we broke. We followed the 7110. We gave PAE Tower more than standard separation; and we expected them to fulfill their part of the LOA. If the 250 heading to 2;000 wasn't going to work because they allowed the first aircraft to do a stop and go or touch and go; they should have called us to APPREQ an alternate missed approach with the second aircraft. We do the same operation at Tacoma Narrows; and it has never been a problem. If they can't give us standard separation with two missed approaches; they call and ask for something different. This feels very systemic to me because I feel like my trainee and I followed the rules. When I ask other controllers here what their take on it is; they all say that they would have done the exact same thing we did; and would have expected PAE Tower to separate the aircraft. Every controller here interprets the rule as I do; but a few upper management people interpret it differently; and obviously PAE Tower is uncertain of the duties for which they are responsible. This will continue to happen unless this is addressed; and responsibilities are clarified. It also concerns me because I was told; 'don't worry about this; it won't be on you. It was very busy and the positions should have been de-combined; so your supervisor is going to buy this one.' This is disturbing to me. I was involved in a loss of separation; which management believes my actions caused; but I wasn't informed; and when I asked about it; I was casually told not to worry about it. How can they just assume that the loss of separation happened due to the fact that we were busy; without even discussing it with us? This is supposed to be a reporting culture; and this applies to management; as well controllers. The loss of separation had nothing to do with how busy we were. If it was half as busy; the same thing would have happened; because that's how I have been led to understand the rule. Furthermore; I reviewed the report that was completed on this event; and it is unjustly scathing towards the S46 controller. Report notes: 'S46 controller changed the missed approach on Aircraft Y to fly heading 250 and maintain 2;000.' Incorrect. The missed approach was never changed. My trainee issued the missed approach to be flown; as required by our LOA with PAE Tower. I'm not sure that [name removed] is aware of our LOA with PAE ATCT. Report QA findings: 'there was a loss of standard separation when Aircraft X completed a touch and go and Aircraft Y started his missed approach over the approach end. The S46 controller did not issue traffic to Aircraft Y on Aircraft X.' PAE was IFR; and my trainee had the situational awareness to know that since both aircraft were IMC; a traffic call would have been a wasted transmission; 'not sure why the controller didn't recognize the conflict and turn Aircraft X.' I'm very confused by this statement. I listened to the voice recording multiple times; and my trainee turned Aircraft X immediately.I feel like there needs to be more transparency from management to controllers. How can someone be involved in a loss of separation; where the closestproximity was 1.76 miles and 100 feet; and not be informed? If I did something that they believe is wrong; I should be informed and kept in the loop. I know about this event because I took it upon myself to pursue the information. I went to QA. I looked it up on Falcon. I looked up the report. I listened to the audio playback. I did all this stuff; not because someone told me to; but because I have pride in my job; and if I make a mistake; I want to take action to correct it. I'm the first person to admit when I know I've made a mistake; and I use the opportunity to improve. Similarly; if I'm being blamed for a loss of separation that I don't believe I'm responsible for; I want the opportunity to absolve myself. If management believes that S46 controllers are responsible for the separation of two aircraft conducting pre-arranged missed approaches; then the part in our LOA that says PAE Tower is responsible for separating departures from departures and arrivals from departures needs to be removed. In my mind; there is huge confusion as to who is really responsible for what. And it's not just me. It's all controllers at S46.Rather than just projecting that the loss of separation happened because we were busy; those involved in the investigation should have discussed it with us. How can they assume that the error happened due to how busy we were; without even considering that perhaps we simply misunderstood a rule?I would like clarification on whether or not we were at fault; or whether we failed to comply with a rule in some way. I would love management to brief this scenario to every crew; explain to each controller here what we did wrong; and why we were wrong. This is systemic. S46 controllers expect PAE ATCT controllers to perform a duty that they seem to be unaware they are responsible for. This will happen again and again if there is no further guidance or clarification.",,,,"S46 Controller describes a training session where he and the Developmental do everything correct; in their mind.

I noticed the overtake and asked the Local controller (LC) if the monitor was taking care of that. The reply was nope they haven't said a word. After IFR separation was lost the final monitor controller called the LC controller and said are you going to break him out? The LC controller said isn't that your job. The final monitor did nothing with the aircraft; and the LC controller turned around and told the FLM (Front Line Manager) what should I do with these two? The FLM did not respond or give any answer so the controller let him land.This is a common problem at this facility where the final monitors do not pay attention to the traffic. They are reactive and not proactive to the aircraft situations.

It was -11 degrees and fine crystalline snow was both falling and blowing around. Braking action and visibility were both variable and poor. When we pushed back; we were told which departure runway to expect and we briefed the performance and routing for that runway and proceeded to the J Pad deicing area. The deicing area is comprised of two deicing areas sandwiched by three taxiways and bordered by four unimproved areas. The taxiways are defined by painted lines and flush green line centerline lights which were mostly obscured by snow. As our deicing was wrapping up; we were told by Ground that we would depart from a different runway. This is a classic 'out of the Green' scenario requiring new performance calculations and route planning. Because of obscuration; there was no visible way to distinguish the boundaries of the ramp areas versus the designated taxiways other than clear ways between deice trucks and aircraft and tire tracks which were all over the place. Because the Denver Airport is so physically huge and complicated; its taxi chart details are tiny and vast. I had a reasonable idea of where I needed to go; but no way to verify that it was correct. Trying to figure out how to manage risks with resources; I came to the conclusion that I needed to turn on the Own Ship display feature on the EFB. It was a godsend. It allowed me to verify where I needed to go rather than guess and; when we came upon a patch where we could briefly see the green centerline lights; they verified that we were exactly where we were supposed to be.

They build all night flying on the beginning of trips where pilots are coming from days off; and from a day schedule into an all nighter. This is not natural. Further; after such a first flight; they schedule a 12 hour layover where pilots are getting little over six hours sleep; if that. This is something pilots do not talk about. A minimum of 24hrs (30hrs if west to east all nighter flown) should be mandated by FAA after an all night flight. This would ensure a rest period to catch up and balance a pilots circadian rhythm. A natural pairing would be to start a trip on a natural day schedule maybe flying late afternoon landing at midnight or slightly after midnight. This would create a gradual progression into night flying. My flight sequence in question started this way. The first flight was an all-night flight was scheduled to ZZZ. This pairing was originally scheduled as a XA52 departure; with an arrival at XG54.Our contract defines All Night Flying as a flight segment; any portion of which; scheduled to operate from 02:30-03:29.We ended up late with a return to gate for a SPEED BRAKE DO NOT ARM light causing a departure of XA10. This resulted in an arrival of XH12; over 1 hour and 18 minutes late. Our layover was scheduled for XC11. I got to room at XJ00 and laid my head down at XJ15 I woke up at XO30 receiving 5:15 hours of sleep.  Was not able to get back to sleep.I was rested enough to sign in 'fit for duty' as I felt good enough to fly. This is where the company places the next problematic area; through scheduling; to circadian rhythm and flying. Instead of scheduling--on last day of a pairing - AFTER AN ALL NIGHT FLIGHT-ONE LEG home...they schedule two legs. These are not short legs either. Consider this pairing; a first flight of 2:18 minutes; with a 1:05 sit; to then pick up the next leg; a 3:47 minute flight to our home base.  By the way; on paper this seems reasonable; [although] some past pairings I have flown this scenario with a sit greater than three hours. That is absolutely atrocious how bad you feel after that trip. While airborne on our first leg both myself and First Officer discussed how tired we were and made a joint decision it was not in the best interest of flight safety to continue. Mind you this was a last leg to get home; but we still felt it prudent to call fatigued. Here are some suggestions to the FAA on fatigue concerns; which I continue to write in about regardless of whether I call in fatigued or not; concerns based on pairings our company continues to build.1. Minimum 24hrs off after any all-night flight. (30hrs if from west coast to east coast all nighter)2. All night flights should be avoided on the first flight of a pairing. (It is unnatural to go from a daytime schedule to an all night flying environment without a gradual transition)3. If an all night flight is flown in the middle of a pairing; a minimum of 24hrs off from duty is mandated. (Established from where a pilot started. West to east 30hrs. East to west 24hrs.)4. If the FAA is going to allow airlines to schedule all night flying; without a requirement to have 24hrs off from duty after the all night flight; then no more than one leg may be flown to ensure that pilots are not being pushed to an unsafe level of performance simply because the corporation is willing to allow an 'acceptable risk' formula for operating commercial aircraft.",,,,"A B737 Captain discussed; with pertinent details; his concerns with respect to the fatigue inducing manner in which flight crew pairing sequences including all night flying are scheduled by his air carrier.

The aircraft rolled approximately three feet before it was apparently stopped by the flight crew with them re-applying the brakes.

Aircraft started down and crossed MAYOS intersection at 280 knots and FL220; MAYOS has a constraint of 280 knots and cross between FL260 & FL240. Because of the initial cruise altitude of FL180; the higher altitude constraints were deleted by the FMS. After receiving a climb clearance to FL240; we manually re-entered the higher constraints. For MAYOS we entered 280KTS and a hard altitude of FL240 (our current cruise altitude). All constraints were then re-checked by both pilots and were properly displayed on the navigational display. Approximately 10 miles prior to top of descent I armed the descent mode. At some point the FMS deleted the MAYOS altitude constraint and descended to FL220 which is the next constraint for KIYEN intersection. This resulted in a low crossing over MAYOS. For many years prior to the IVAN arrival; MAYOS had a FL220 crossing altitude. I believe this helped contribute to our missing the FMS deleting the FL240 constraint over MAYOS.

About 15 miles from the airport approach informed us that the runway had changed and to expect the visual to runway 15. He gave us direct to JERIT and a descent to 2;000 feet. The Pilot Monitoring (PM) changed the runways in the FMS but we did not have time to set up the ILS. As we approached JERIT (the final in the ILS 15) While level at 2;000 feet I disengaged the autopilot to keep from smart turning at JERIT before we had clearance for the visual. The PM asked if I would like the ALTITUDE ALERT set to field level. I said OK but really didn't know why he asked this question. In retrospect I should have questioned the selection.  Intent on searching for the field altitude dropped out of my scan and at about 4 miles from the field we got a 1;000 foot call from the EGPWS I reset the Altitude Alert Display (AAD) to 1;500 feet to stay above 1;000 feet AGL just as ATC said they had an altitude alert and asked if we had the field in site.  We said we were correcting and had the field in site and he cleared us for the visual approach.  Since we were in the turn inside of JERIT approaching thee miles I remained at 1;500 feet and made an uneventful landing.In my self-review of this event I relearned a couple of things.  We got a runway change close in and that put us into a time compression situation.  Since we were coming in from the north slowing; configuring and getting the runway changed in the FMS was no small task.  While the PM managed to reset the FMS we were too busy to reset the courses and minimums; much less brief the approach; this didn't concern me too much since the conditions were VMC; but do I try to have backup NAV to any airport I fly into.  Alternative actions could have been to ask to land on runway 33 anyway; the winds were not prohibitive and the airport was not busy. If they demanded we use runway 15 we could have asked for delaying vectors until we were fully set. Struggling to find the airport in a sea of lights in a large metropolitan area is difficult at best. It's best to stay on the automation to protect yourself from things dropping out of your scan.  If I had selected heading; I would not have had to concern myself with the airplane turning prematurely and stayed with the automation and been altitude protected. Finally; if the PM recommends a change to the flight panel that doesn't sound quite right; question him.

He noted that the rudder trim knob would not move. We both tried moving the rudder trim knob left and right independently and it would not move either direction. I pressed on each rudder pedal and I could yaw the aircraft very slightly with the autopilot on.  We discussed our options and the PF communicated with our company in order to utilize all of our resources and comply with the FOM. We made a plan in the event that we did not regain rudder control and a plan in the event rudder control was restored.Once the descent was started the PF tested rudder authority several times during the decent and at FL230 (temp -11 C) rudder control and trim were restored. The rest of the flight proceeded uneventfully. The Pilot in Command (PIC) did note that rudder forces were higher than normal during the taxi after landing. The PIC made a maintenance entry noting the issue.We were both aware of frozen rudder events from reading the ASAP newsletter and considered that as a possible explanation of the issue. I had noted water draining from a drain hole in the bottom of the rear access compartment (hellhole) in Boca Raton that morning while the APU was running.

Visibility for the crew dropped to zero for the remainder of the takeoff roll and climb out.  An abort was impossible and the initial climb-out; surrounded by high terrain; was an unacceptable safety risk.  The windscreen remained opaque for the first 1-2 minutes of flight.This procedure creates an unacceptable safety risk to our crews; passengers; and aircraft.

As PIC of the flight; the degradation of safety is too great and I cannot comply with the procedure as written.","Reporter stated this was the first takeoff with the new procedure; thus the first time they had to deal with Type IV fluid flowing over the windshield.

I kept my feet on the rudders to as close as I could imagine was putting us down the centerline and lifted off. This all took place in a matter of seconds; but the timing could not have been worse. If we had to do an abort; there would be zero visibility out of the window and there would have been a very slim chance of a successful abort. This is extremely unsafe and we almost had an aircraft accident because of it. Type IV is very thick and heavy and is probably why it took so long for the fluid to lift and cover the windshield at such a critical flight phase.

At this point the Cherokee had passed the intersection and ATC said cleared to cross and taxi to 3. He made a comment about how he could understand my confusion.

Passing thru approximately 2500 feet on that heading; Oakland Center cleared us to FL230 and direct ALB (2200 miles away).

We advised Center we were complying with the RA and the controllers response was 'oh yeah I was going to point that out; he's at 3500 feet'.  After passing the traffic and the TA/RA cleared; we resumed our climb and turned on course without further event.Suggestions:For crew:  set TCAS to above instead of norm to give crew a little more visibility during the initial climb phase.  Though in this case; the crew was already looking outside and may not have seen the traffic icon much sooner.  This can result in information overload in high density areas and is not my standard practice.For ATC:  priority should be given to pointing out VFR traffic instead of clearing us to a fix that is 2200 miles away.  This required the pilot not flying (PNF) to go heads-down and program the FMS at a fairly low altitude.  On a weekend day when there is a large amount of VFR traffic. The crew's attention is needed outside the aircraft.  We recognize that it is always the crew's responsibility to see and avoid when in VMC; but if the  controller had the time and open airspace to clear us direct across the country; then that same controller also had the time to point out traffic; which was the more immediate and pressing issue.",,,,"CL30 pilot reported an NMAC with a light aircraft climbing out of APC; commenting that an earlier heads-up from ATC would have been appreciated.",

When the CA changed the speeds on the legs page to 300 knots; the altitude constraints on the legs page disappeared; BHAWK turned white on the NAV display and the aircraft immediately began a 90 degree right turn; though the next fix ahead; STNLE was now the active waypoint on the legs page. The CA engaged Heading Select and rotated the heading bug back to the left to rejoin the lateral arrival path; but the aircraft was very; very slow to reverse course in the Auto-Pilot (A/P) mode.  The aircraft continued to descend as the CA disconnected the A/P; increased the left turn rate to rejoin the lateral path and leveled the aircraft now below FL220 just prior to BHAWK.  The controller queried us and I acknowledged that we had descended below the BHAWK altitude limit.  The controller indicated that there was no traffic conflict at that point.  After BHAWK; the CA re-selected the A/P; LNAV & VNAV and continued the arrival.It continues to be my experience that controller directed altitude and/or airspeed changes to arrival profiles require significant pilot attention allocation at dynamic moments to execute the changes in the FMC at multiple waypoints.

We rejoined our lateral track of the GPS ground track to line us up with the runway and activate the secondary flight plan in case of a balked landing. When we switched with tower he asked us if we were still on the GPS approach. We then told him that we were on a visual and approx 4 nm for the field. Several moments later we were cleared to land runway 31. As we exited the runway ground said he had a question for us. He asked ' are we allowed to do visuals since he had never seen a crew accept that clearance'. This alarmed both of us in the flight deck so we read over the notes again to find Visual Procedures N/A.

I went ahead 5-10 seconds later and asked ATC for runway 7R full stop. During Post Flight we looked and wing; flap and landing gear. We saw gravel stain on outboard side of left wheel. I noticed the strut was a little low as well. I called Dispatch and told them we were on the ground and needed Maintenance to take a look at the aircraft. Maintenance (MX) came out quickly; and I explained what happened. While Maintenance was inspecting the flaps and landing gear for any damage or dent; I noticed; there were some dents and a quarter size hole on Leading Edge of Left Stabilator.

A second assumption of control expression was successful and the instructor regained aircraft control but the left main landing gear had already contacted gravel alongside the runway; some of which was thrown aft and struck the aircraft.

Maintenance Control was contacted by ZZZ Line maintenance to report the Scavenge Fuel Pump Control circuit breaker on panel 132VU at location K63 (FIN # 13QQ) was tripped.  My responsibility in these events was to approve the actions taken to address this issue by way of the completion of the Audit Process per Maintenance Control procedures 04.02.01.  My refusal to complete the audit process was based on the following:       1). Aircraft Maintenance Manual (AMM) 28-11-4-0401 for the replacement of the Fuel Scavenge Pump begins with a blanket warning that this is a Critical Design Configuration Control Limitation (CDCCL) item and 'You must keep all CDCCL items in the approved configuration'. The company's position to me was this CDCCL warning only applies to the replacement of this pump. I disagree. If you were to change the connector on this pump would not the CDCCL warning still apply?  This circuit breaker was powering the control relays that are external to the tank; but are they still not part of the Scavenge Fuel Pump System?  Is this system as a whole not part of the CDCCL concept?  Would not the same CDCCL warnings apply?  The CDCCL warnings in AMM 28-11-41-0401 do not identify the procedure of replacing the pump as the CDCCL concern. Rather; AMM 28-11-41-0401 says the procedure of replacing the pump 'USES' a fuel system 'ITEM' that is in a category known as CDCCL. The 'ITEM/SYSTEM' itself is the CDCCL concern. The deferrals MXXXX74 and DXXXX77 together; change the approved configuration of this CDCCL system.        2). In my view the actions taken were out of the scope of the General Maintenance Manual (GMM) 03.05.01 by using a simple 'D' item  and required an Engineering Order (EO) to address the issue. Per GMM 03.05.01; 'If the recommended action is not contained within an applicable manual it will be necessary to obtain concurrence and instruction from Engineering through the issuance of an EO.' What manual was produced by ZZZ Line Maintenance or Engineering allowing Maintenance Control to pull this circuit breaker or deviate from the CDCCL warning?      3). Per GMM 03.05.01; 'Additional engineering concurrence may be necessary'. What has developed out of this process is a pattern of Engineering telling Maintenance Control and Line Maintenance that the issue at hand can be handled using GMM 03.05.01 by 'just put a 'D' item on it per the GMM'.  This is an overreach by the Engineering Department. Per GMM 03.02.01; 'Maintenance Control will administer and control deferred items (MEL; CDL and DMI)'.   This GMM is clear that the responsibility for the legality of the deferral process is with Maintenance Control.  That decision may or may not require engineering concurrence. It may require the Engineering department to produce an EO to address the fault. Engineering should not be telling Maintenance Control what procedure is needed to defer any item.        4). What was causing the circuit breaker to trip?  Proper troubleshooting was not applied to find the root cause for the circuit breaker to trip.  Do we have a short?  Per Airbus A300 Electrical Standards Practices Manual (ESPM) Manual 20-10-00; Para 2; this is a violation.      Lastly I felt very pressured to agree to this process. Even more so after I expressed my concerns. I was told by the Maintenance Control management to work as directed and complete the audit process.  Under the threat of discipline I completed the audit process and submitted this report.  In the safety first environment of Maintenance Control; the pressure I felt to agree to these deferrals runs counterproductive and does not build bridges for better working relations. Aircraft delay. Fuel Distribution System. Fuel System: General.  Extreme Cold.",,"February 2015; I; Maintenance Controller Y; received a phone call from a Line Mechanic X in ZZZ on an A300 aircraft; that was scheduled to depart that night.  Line Mechanic said the crew found Circuit Breaker K63 (13QQ) on 132VU panel was tripped and would not reset.  The Circuit Breaker (K63) is part of the Water Scavenge System in the Aircraft fuel tanks and is deferrable as per A300 MEL 28-11-41 with a Dispatch Procedure (DP) of 28-11-14 to be accomplished; however the DP does not direct the mechanic to pull and collar this Circuit Breaker.  I conferenced us with Engineer X for a possible issuance of an Engineering Order (EO) to allow maintenance to pull and collar this Circuit Breaker due to the fact that the fuel tank Water Scavenge System is a system that is associated with (SFAR) 88 Critical Design Configuration Control Limitation (CDCCL) and has tripped and cannot be reset; and also being aware of the necessity to maintain design features that are critical to preventing ignition sources from developing within the fuel tank system.       After approx. 15 minutes researching Aircraft Wiring Manual (AWM) 28-11-01; Engineer X directed us to use new General Maintenance Manual (GMM) 03.05.01 and to pull and collar Circuit Breaker K63 (13QQ) and to defer the Water Scavenge System as per MEL 28-11-41.  I was reluctant to use the GMM 03.05.01 reference and would prefer an Engineering Order due to the involvement of a CDCCL system and the warnings issued in Aircraft Maintenance Manual (AMM) 28-11-41-0401; where it states 'You must keep all CDCCL items in the approved configuration.  Damage; wear; or changes to a CDCCL item can cause a possible fuel tank explosion.'  I felt that an Engineering Order would be a more suitable and appropriate direction to follow since I believe this to be a Safety Of Flight issue.  My fellow Controller that night on the Airbus desk; Controller X; concurred along with Maintenance Control Supervisor X; originally.  Engineer X however; insisted that GMM 03.05.01 was applicable and should suffice in this case; since K63 (13QQ) was only a control Circuit Breaker that went to relays; not to the fuel tank and that AMM 28-11-41-0401 just dealt with the bonding of the scavenge pump if it were to be replaced.  No Engineering Order was required or forthcoming.      I requested an aircraft swap so we can at least identify what was causing Circuit Breaker K63 (13QQ) to trip and not to reset; since this was associated with a sensitive CDCCL system.  Maintenance Control Manager X; Maintenance Control Supervisor Y and now Maintenance Control Supervisor X did not agree and instructed me to work as directed and to issue both deferrals and for Controller X to also audit both deferrals.  I contacted Tech Support Mr. X and Tech Support Supervisor X for further concurrence and both said it was OK to use GMM 03.05.01 and directed me to issue both deferrals against my better judgment. I issued both deferrals MXXXX74 and DXXXX77; reference Log page items #1 and #2 as directed by Maintenance Control management and submitted this report.  We instructed [Line] Mechanic X to also submit a report because Controller X and I would be submitting a report on this matter.       Several controllers have issued complaints to management in reference to the legality of GMM 03.05.01 with Safety OF Flight concerns.  For example; one step in this GMM; prior to issuing a deferral; states that 'Disconnecting and securing an electrical connector; draining and/or capping hydraulic; fuel; water; or pneumatic lines; pulling Circuit Breakers; and capping and stowing of electrical wires; provided there is: No effect on Flight Manual Supplements'; we cannot verify this step in Maintenance Control and no one seems to know how to access this information; therefore; I believe we should not be using this new GMM 03.05.01 reference.  I am aware of the complaint issued by our Air Carrier to allow GMM deviation from Dispatch Procedures; howeverthe deviation must be simple and routine in nature to rectify an unsafe condition of a component.  In the case with a sensitive CDCCL component; I believe an Engineering Order was required to assure continued Safety Of Flight.  In summary; our primary concern with the issuance of these two deferrals was the tripping of Circuit Breaker K63 (13QQ); which was from a CDCCL associated system.  The cause of the tripping Circuit Breaker was never addressed by Engineering.  In the past; before an Engineering Order was issued for a tripping Circuit Breaker; a cause ALWAYS needed to be addressed before an Engineering Order was issued; now with this new GMM reference a cause is no longer required.  WHY? What has changed?? Is a short in the aircraft wiring no longer important??  Task 28-00-00-840 Airworthiness Limitations Precautions states 'Strict adherence to configuration; methods; techniques; and practices as prescribed to make sure that the CDCCL is complied with.  Use of parts; methods; techniques or practices not contained in the applicable CDCCL must be approved by the FAA office that is responsible for the Aircraft model type certificate or applicable regulatory agency.'",,"Two Maintenance Controllers are directed under threat of discipline to issue two deferrals under their General Maintenance Manual (GMM) for a water scavenge system in an A300's aircraft fuel tank and a Scavenge Fuel Pump Control Circuit Breaker (CB) K63 that would not reset. Both Controllers believed an Engineering Order (EO) was required due to the scavenge pump control CB's association with Special Federal Aviation Regulation 88 and Critical Design Configuration Control Limitation (CDCCL). The Line Mechanic also requests clarification of the two contradicting statements in their GMM as to the necessity of an EO when deviating from an MEL.",

During the takeoff briefing it was stated by the PIC/PF that we would not return to the departure airport if there was a mechanical malfunction due to the gusty crosswinds and short runways. After taking off we experienced a mechanical malfunction when attempting to raise the landing gear after 400 feet. The main landing gear did not retract but the nose wheel did. We had two green main indications no nose wheel and the red gear unlocked/unsafe light.When the malfunction occurred the SIC (Second in Command); without communicating with the PIC on a plan of action or pulling out the Emergency Abnormal checklist; immediately communicated to tower that we wanted to return to the pattern (against the takeoff brief agreement and without communicating to the PIC/PF).What followed was a serious breakdown in CRM and a failure to 'Aviate; Navigate; Communicate' in that order as all pilot's primary training correctly mandates.After trying to get the SIC/PM to stop communicating with ATC; the SIC became angry saying he was trying to 'do his job' and the PIC stated 'well in that case I need you to communicate to them that we are climbing to 3;000 feet and proceeding on a 090 degree heading; that we'd like to go to the nearby Class B Departure; and then I want you to pull out the Emergency Abnormal checklist and find Landing Gear Will Not Retract and begin reading it out loud'.The SIC then stated that he was 'pissed off' and the PIC stated 'too bad'; I need you to follow my instructions.After about 90 seconds to 2 minutes and during this exchange; the landing gear retracted on its own. At this point the PIC directed the SIC to communicate to the nearby Class B departure that we wanted to change our destination to another airport; which is home base.They asked if we needed assistance and we told them no; since the airplane was now cleaned up. We were given a heading and altitude and a new clearance for home base airport.We continued running the associated checklist during the climb; and stopped at Landing Gear Down.  We waited until the appropriate time in the descent and approach to complete it from that point; which we did without incident; and we landed normally.",,,,"A CE680 main landing gear failed to retract after takeoff with the gear handle up.

My autopilot (an STEC 55X) was engaged with altitude capture. It is connected to a Garmin G500 PFD. I had entered the correct altimeter setting (30.34) in the G500 prior to takeoff and entered 4000 feet as my cruise altitude.During climb; well prior reaching 4;000 feet; I noticed that my heading information on the G500 had failed as indicated by a small red 'X' and the word 'Heading'. This happens occasionally and can be caused by various forms of interference. It rarely lasts more than a minute and then the warning goes away. Prior to reaching my assigned altitude; the G500 was operating normally again.When my autopilot leveled off at 4;000; ATC called and said 'I show you at 4;400 feet. Descend to 4;000 altimeter 30.34.' I acknowledged and looked at my altimeter setting and it was 29.92. Somehow during the failure of the heading mode; the G500 had reset the altimeter setting. I later contacted Garmin and they said this should not have happened. I am still investigating this. Lessons learned: cross check altitudes when leveling off. I have a backup; classic steam gauge altimeter but I never looked at it - only my primary G500 altimeter. Second; if there is any glitch or anomaly with the PFD; all settings must be checked (even though Garmin says they shouldn't be lost). An observation: Many GA pilots have upgraded their panels from the old mechanical instruments to 'glass.' I suspect only a small fraction of these are familiar with all the various failure modes of their new equipment. Moreover; when we go to training; the instructors we fly with are not familiar with the failure modes either so we don't learn them there. I know it is the PIC responsibility to be familiar with their equipment but how many pilots read the hundreds of pages of the operators' manual?",,,,"The pilot of a turbocharged Cessna twin was climbing to his cleared altitude of 4;000 MSL when he noted the latest example of a recurring nuisance heading failure alert on his GARMIN PFD. As before; the alert went away shortly and the climb was continued. After leveling; ATC advised he was reporting 4;400 MSL vice 4;000 as cleared and provided the altimeter setting of 30.34; the same as was set in the PFD prior to departure. When the reporter checked he was surprised to note that the setting had changed to 29.92; apparently during the previous PDF heading anomaly. Of particular interest is his last paragraph addressing the little discussed but widely realized fact that few converts to glass cockpit retrofits in their aircraft are totally familiar with all that is included in the several hundred page users' manuals.",

Also ensured that squat switches were unobstructed. I taxied at a slow rate en-route to runway XY to ensure the minimum buildup of slush and ice on the landing gear. Brakes were used extensively to keep the aircraft at a slow taxi speed and to utilize the residual brake heat for preventing contamination of the main landing gear.  A normal takeoff was executed. During our takeoff briefing I stated that we would leave the landing gear down for one minute after takeoff. We followed through with the plan but the landing gear would not retract. Cycled the landing gear one more time with no success. I instructed the First Officer to ask ATC if we could maintain 8;000 since the aircraft would not pressurize in ground mode. ATC granted our request. Next we activated the main wing anti-ice system in an attempt to use the excess bleed air; vented through the main landing gear well; to melt the contamination on the squat switches. After 10 minutes we attempted gear retraction two more times with no success. Also tried disengaging the anti-skid system and pumping the brakes with no effect. At that point we elected to return to Airport ZZZ but recognized we were over max landing weight and would need to burn off fuel for 15 to 20 minutes. ATC vectored us in the southeastern portion of their airspace. While on vectors; still at 8;000 feet; we also tried increasing speed from less than 200 knots to 250 knots hoping it would shed more of the contamination off the landing gear. We may have been underneath the Class Bravo airspace at this time. We executed a normal descent; approach; and landing at ZZZ on runway XY. After taxi-in and shutdown we observed an abundance of ice had accumulated on the main landing gear. A discrepancy was noted in the aircraft's maintenance log.",,,,"Despite efforts to reduce landing gear exposure to the winter elements during preflight and taxi out; following takeoff the flight crew of a LJ-31 was unable to raise the landing gear.

In the vicinity of the city of Half Moon Bay; CA; I turned northeast-bound to follow Highway 92 (the low spot in the terrain) over the hill into the San Francisco Bay Area. I was flying at 2800 feet MSL to cross over the hilly terrain; this is Class E airspace. At that time I was talking to NorCal TRACON on 135.1 MHz and after passing over the highest ridge transmitted to NorCal TRACON '[Aircraft ID] VFR descent; landing San Carlos with [alpha designator of the current SQL ATIS].'NorCal TRACON replied 'VFR descent approved' as I began my descent; and as I was passing through 2500 feet MSL; NorCal advised me of traffic at 10 o'clock. I replied that I was looking for that traffic; and after a short while asked for a traffic update since I still hadn't identified the traffic. NorCal TRACON responded advising traffic at 10 o'clock and [X] mile (I don't remember the exact distance). I did see an aircraft in the distance just north of the SQL runway but did not know if that was the aircraft NorCal TRACON had indicated; that aircraft was so far in the distance it was not a factor. I don't remember whether I pointed out this distant traffic to NorCal TRACON; but I did not receive any further traffic notifications from NorCal TRACON. At this stage I was continuing my descent so as to remain under the SFO Class Bravo airspace using normal maneuvers and a stabilized descent (I know that I must be under 1500 feet MSL prior to crossing Highway 101 and the SFO VOR 120 radial) and maneuvering for the expected SQL pattern entry from that area; which would be to cross midfield overhead of SQL at 1200 feet MSL and turn into a right downwind for runway 30. I was also looking vigilantly to see if there was another aircraft closer to me which was actually the traffic that NorCal TRACON had indicated. Eventually NorCal TRACON said exactly 'Radar services terminated; contact San Carlos Tower' with no instruction regarding my transponder code. I acknowledged NorCal TRACON's instruction and continued to squawk my previously assigned transponder code. As this airplane is not equipped with GPS nor a moving map; I use the VOR & DME equipment on board in conjunction with visual landmarks and my paper SFO Terminal Area Chart for positional awareness.I switched my radio to the SQL Tower frequency. The SQL Tower controller spoke to two different aircraft and then called out my aircraft callsign before I could get a word in. I responded with my callsign and that I was landing San Carlos with Information [alpha designator of the current SQL ATIS]. At this stage I was still southwest of the Highway 101 and the SFO 120 radial. The SQL Tower controller instructed me to cross midfield overhead of SQL at 1200 feet MSL and turn into a right downwind for runway 30; and I read back those instructions. The SQL Tower controller then said to another aircraft 'Now I'm in contact with that aircraft' and I think he meant me. Then the SQL Tower controller said to me 'Possible pilot deviation; we'll give you the number to call the tower after you land' and I acknowledged that transmission. This was my first indication that something was wrong; but it did corroborate with my impression that I had experienced a really late handoff from NorCal TRACON to SQL Tower; which I assumed was because NorCal wanted to make sure that I had identified the indicated traffic at 10 o'clock before handing me off.I made a normal landing at SQL on runway 30. I taxied to parking and secured my aircraft.I then called the SQL Tower and the manager on duty answered. He said that I needed to comply with FAR 91 rules prior to entering the SQL Class D surface area and that he believed I had committed a Class D airspace entry violation. He said that the SQL Tower controller had been trying to contact me while I was descending and I had not responded. I explained the chain of events as described above and that I thought that I had satisfied the SQL Class D entry requirements by being in two-way communication with NorCal TRACON; that I thought that I was getting handed off from NorCal to SQL Tower; and that NorCal TRACON was advising me of traffic that I could not positively identify. The manager asked the SQL Tower controller whether he had received me as a handoff from NorCal TRACON; SQL Tower did not receive such a handoff.The SQL Tower manager on duty said that for IFR flight plans TRACON is responsible for handing the flight over to the landing tower; but for VFR flight plans or flight following TRACON will coordinate handoffs through transition airports and it is the pilot's responsibility to establish contact with the airport of landing prior to entering the airspace of the landing airport. After receiving this counsel from the SQL Tower manager on duty I said that this was a key point of my misunderstanding; that I thought that during this flight I was receiving a handoff from NorCal TRACON to SQL Tower that would satisfy the Class Delta airspace entry requirements.The SQL Tower manager on duty said that in this instance I should have remained above his Class Delta airspace at 2100 feet MSL; and of course below the Class Bravo airspace that begins at 4000 feet MSL; and requested a frequency change from NorCal TRACON so that I could establish two-way radio communications with SQL Tower prior to my descent into SQL Class D airspace.I appreciate the counseling provided by the tower manager and regret my misunderstanding that NorCal TRACON was in fact not handing me off to SQL Tower. The counseling provided me with better understanding of how the two ATC facilities coordinate between one another. I believed that I was complying with ATC instructions and advisories being provided to me by NorCal TRACON; without realizing that the SQL Tower controller was not aware of my communications with NorCal TRACON and their traffic advisories. Because I was squawking a discrete transponder code; I further thought that SQL Tower was aware of my aircraft on its radar display. From this experience I've learned a valuable lesson to ensure that this misunderstanding does not recur.",,,,"Pilot reports of being under flight following then told to contact the tower.

Our clearance was the RUUDY5 departure GAYEL transition; etc... I had to manually program our FMS-GNSXLS- for WENTZ @1500 feet; TASCA @2000 feet and RUUDY intersections; and then the GAYEL transition. When we departed RWY 24 @ TEB; I was in heading mode to intercept the 260 degree course to WENTZ. I switched to NAV to track to WENTZ and cross @ 1500 feet. Crossing WENTZ; I switched back to heading mode to track 280 degree to TASCA to cross @ 2000 feet. We were cleared to climb to 10;000 feet. The PNF then switched back to Navigation (NAV) mode after crossing TASCA. Because the FMS had been programmed for the GAYEL transition; the autopilot turned north to GAYEL before crossing RUUDY because it is a 90 degree turn. We should have been back in heading mode and departed RUUDY on a 280 degree heading until vectors to GAYEL. ATC stated; 'XXX; I don't know where you are going but you should be heading 280 degrees'. We turned to 280 degrees and climbed to 10;000 feet. There was no conflict with other aircraft.After talking to the Pilot Not Flying (PNF) and the other pilots in our flight department; we have decided to not accept this departure (RUUDY5) because of the age of our FMS; the switching of modes 3 times in 8 miles while climbing; cleaning up of the aircraft; running checklist; avoiding traffic; and abiding by the noise abatement procedure for RWY24 at TEB.",,,,"The flight crew of an HS125 attempted to fly the RUUDY SID from TEB using a rapid reprogramming of heading and navigation modes in order to comply with the charted heading and fix to fix routing involved.

ATC then issued a climb clearance to 6000 feet. I placed 6000 in the altitude alert window and engaged a Vertical Speed Mode of +1000 FPM. Immediately after receiving the climb clearance; ATC advised me that I could expect Radar Vectors to POM then to track outbound on the 295R. I was then given another climb clearance to 7000 feet. I then placed 7000 in the Altitude Alert Window. With this previously issued 'Expect' clearance; I then began to construct that routing in the MFD Routing so that when officially cleared to fly that route; I could then engage the appropriate Roll NAV Mode. While I was building the expected routing; ATC contacted asked if we were experiencing any problems because he showed me descending. Upon ATC query; I refocused my attention to the vertical path of the aircraft. At that point; I observed that indeed we were descending instead of climbing and the Autopilot was not engaged in any vertical mode but was tracking in Heading Mode. I intervened by disconnecting the Autopilot and manually initiated a climb to 7000.I do not know why or how the Autopilot dropped out of the Vertical Speed Mode. It was ATC's observation and communication that caused me to correct the situation. However; I do believe my exuberance to 'pre-load' the 'Expect' routing clearance; caused me to become fixated on the programing of that route and I failed to continue to monitor the immediate and actual aircraft progress.While the moment was a period of higher flight deck workload; the expectation and trust in automation should never create a complacent attitude that prevents required aircraft monitoring. Less reliance on automation and more attention to aircraft 'state' monitoring would have prevented this occurrence.",,,,"When given a climb from 4000 to 6000 feet and; quickly thereafter; issued an 'expect' lateral routing; the pilot of a CE-510S failed to monitor the aircraft's vertical track while pre-programming the expected new routing.

The reporter included a wise commentary on the need; especially for single pilot operations; to always pay greater attention to 'aircraft 'state' monitoring' even while engaged in required FMS programming.",

My TAS was approximately 140 knots. Winds were 270 at 10 knots and sky was clear with smooth flight conditions.  Heavier aircraft noted above and ahead on approach to runway 22 at JFK.  A 757 heavy was noted in a descending turn from E to W approximately two miles ahead and at least 500 feet above when he crossed my position.  Shortly thereafter I was struck by a tremendous burst of downward force with a rolling moment of 45 degrees to the right.  I was wearing shoulder and lap harnesses but was smashed into the headliner with enough force to suffer extreme pain in my neck and upper body causing a brief period of disorientation.  I was able to recover the aircraft and ultimately make an uneventful landing.  I reported the encounter to FRG Tower and was told that this was becoming more of a problem as ATC was now providing lower altitudes to incoming traffic on approach to runway 22 [L/R] at JFK.  Pilots need to be more aware of wake turbulence as it presents a greater threat to GA aircraft than collisions alone.  I believe that this wake turbulence could be potentially unrecoverable and possibly fatal to some types of aircraft.  Maybe a danger zone could be depicted on moving map displays that is activated through ADS-B when potential conflict are forecast by local conditions.  Similar to taxi collision shading seen on many of the Safe-Taxi charts.

Well into the descent MWA ASOS was finally understandable with significant bleed over of Pontiac ASOS. Based on ASOS information the crew set up for and briefed the RNAV RWY 2 approach to MWA. The Descent and In-Range checklist which was delayed due to the lack of usable ASOS was completed. At this point we were approx. 10 minutes from touchdown. We received a handoff to a new Kansas City Center (KC) controller and on initial contact were told to 'descend to (unsure of exact altitude); expect ILS 20 at MWA and report when you have MWA weather'. Controller did not ask us which runway or approach we wanted but simply told us to expect the ILS 20. The crew quickly discussed whether to accept the ILS 20 or not and after calculating the crosswind/tailwind with the FMS decided to continue for the ILS 20. The crew began to set up for the ILS 20. Upon informing KC that we had the weather at MWA we were cleared direct to JONNY; we had been proceeding direct to the field per our flight plan clearance. This created a shallow intercept angle to the final approach course. The next clearance was to descend to 2700 cleared ILS 20 MWA. Both pilots remarked that 2700 was the MSA and too high to cross JONNY inbound on the ILS as the glideslope (GS) intercept altitude at JONNY was 1990. We quickly discussed querying the controller about the altitude; assuming controller had misspoke; and then finished setting up and briefing the approach. The ILS 20 has a holding pattern in lieu of procedure turn at the LOM/IAF; this is also the missed approach holding pattern. We briefed the approach as a straight-in ILS with a missed approach back to the LOM to hold. (This was incorrect) The next transmission from KC was 'contact MWA tower on 128.4 cleared ILS 20 radar services terminated'. Rather than read back the clearance the First Officer (FO) requested 'we need a lower altitude to make the ILS 20'; expecting to be cleared to 2000. KC cleared us to 2200 and repeated the instruction to contact tower cleared for the ILS 20. We contacted MWA tower stating we were 7 miles north inbound for the ILS 20; tower requested we report crossing JONNY. We were approximately 2 miles from JONNY and leveling off at 2200. The GS and localizer were both 'alive.' The aircraft was fully configured and on speed at 2200 approaching JONNY. Just outside JONNY the Flight director and autopilot 'captured' the localizer and GS. A pitch down was commanded due to the GS being between 1-1.5 dots low. Due to the abruptness of the pitch down the pilot flying (PF) disengaged the autopilot. At this time we crossed JONNY and the non pilot flying (NPF) called the runway in sight. The PF requested the NPF to re-engage the autopilot and continued the approach. The NPF informed MWA tower that we were inside JONNY on the ILS 20 and we were cleared to land. The rest of the approach and landing were uneventful. As tower cleared us into the ramp the controller requested we call him on the phone. We disembarked our passengers and began the process of 'turning' the airplane. Upon re-entering the flight deck to depart the Captain informed a conversation with the tower controller who had been monitoring our transmissions with KC Center [revealed] that we had not been cleared for a straight in ILS as we both believed and briefed and; therefore; had neglected to perform the required procedure turn on the approach. The tower controller had informed the Captain that this is a common problem at this airport on that approach and that they have been trying to find a solution for quite some time.The crew had been flying together for five days and had performed four arrivals into non-towered airports and three arrivals into towered airports. Each non-towered airport was served by an approach control or center facility that allowed for vectoring onto final. The towered airports were radar equipped. MWA was towered but had neither radar nor did KS have the ability to vector us onto final; a factor missed by the crew. We expected to fly a straight-in ILS and due to several factors including compressed workload and phrasing from center we failed to recognize that we weren't on vectors to final and therefore needed to perform the entire approach procedure complete with procedure turn.",,,,"Air carrier First Officer reports bleed through to MWA ASOS from PNT ASOS even though it is far away and on a different frequency.

Aircraft Y was on the GPS F approach into ASE. Aircraft X was launched when that traffic (Aircraft Y) was on a 10 mile final opposite direction. Aircraft X didn't start his take off roll until the arrival traffic was on a 7 mile final. Usually the West bound in front of situation always works with a GPS F approach because the departure and arrival have divergence right when the departure hits 9;100ft.  Aircraft X took forever to roll and was an extremely slow climber because he was heavy. As the CIC; I told the local controller to have Aircraft X fly runway heading to give the two divergence right away. The Aircraft X pilot read it back but he did not comply with it. The local controller did the best he could to make the best out of an already bad situation.   The Aircraft X pilot did what he thought was right but it contradicted what the local controller was telling him to do.  I'm not saying that the local controller didn't do anything wrong but he was trying to make it so the aircraft didn't come as close as they did. The pilot of Aircraft X probably also was used to having ODO operations with traffic on the LOC/DME E approach which in this case he would have passed to the east. The GPS F approach puts that aircraft head on with the departure until he turns at of 9;100 ft so he probably had no idea where that aircraft really was or he expected him to be someone else.  My suggestions are to be aware of your aircraft types and also be aware of where that aircraft is going.",,"Aircraft Y was coming in on the VOR/DME C approach to runway 15; and I had Aircraft X holding short of runway 33 for departure assigned the LINDZ8 SID. I advised Aircraft Y of departing traffic that will be west bound in front of them; and prompted them to maintain slowest practical speed to a 5 mile final for Aircraft X. I then launched Aircraft X off runway 33 with the prompt of no delay on your departure roll for opposite direction traffic one two mile final runway 15. Aircraft X began takeoff roll with Aircraft Y on about a 10-11 mile final runway 15 as Aircraft X became airborne it was clear the situation was deteriorating rapidly; My CIC advised me to have Aircraft X to fly runway heading until reaching 091 for the left turn per the LINDZ8 SID. Aircraft X read back 'runway heading to ninety one hundred' however Aircraft X began the right turn to a 343 heading. At this point I am issuing traffic to both aircraft while utilizing visual separation. I instructed Aircraft X to begin their left turn per the LINDZ8 departure with a fresh traffic call. Aircraft X responded 'we are unable to do that' I then issued traffic to both aircraft and instructed Aircraft X to begin their left turn per the LINDZ8 departure again this time Aircraft X took the turn. And was climbing just above Aircraft Y and flew over top by about 1000 feet therefore resolving the traffic conflict. During this time I had both aircraft in sight and they were separated by visual separation however the situation was less than desirable.Observe the speeds on final more closely and do not anticipate that the aircraft on final will slow to a speed that you need them to.

I had stood up to look at the lighting panel and Aircraft Y calls ready for takeoff runway 29. I was using a hand set because I had left my headset in the tracon. I missed Aircraft Y saying he was at runway 29. Aircraft X calls after Aircraft Y and is on final runway 11. I clear Aircraft X to land Runway 11. I go straight to Aircraft Y and clear them for takeoff Runway 11 Heading 050. Aircraft Y questions the Heading and I said 'Affirmative heading 050 for Aircraft Y.' I told Aircraft Y of the traffic on 7 mile final runway 11. I scanned the runway and saw flashing lights at the approach end of runway 11 and did the scan of the rest of the runway. I did not see the aircraft at the approach end of runway 29. The flashing lights I saw where the barrier lights that separate A1 and A2. After clearing Aircraft Y for takeoff I looked up at the Dbrite to see where Aircraft X was and then I looked down to my notepad to write Aircraft X on the arrival column. I then went to the Aircraft Y strip to write the heading down and then looked back up to see where Aircraft Y was. Out of the corner of my eye I see flashing lights and it is Aircraft Y going the wrong way. I looked back at the strip and it had runway 29 on it. I looked back up at the Dbrite and see Aircraft X and I told Aircraft X to go around climb maintain 4000. I then go back to Aircraft Y and tell them to turn right heading 050 immediately.

I didn't for several reasons. We are at minimal staff; I was the late person; and I have been counseled on taking sick leave. The event happened because Aircraft Y was taxied to the wrong runway. The second problem happened when I missed the call saying Aircraft Y was at runway 29; possibly due to having the hand set and not the head set; the pilot did not question the clearance for takeoff on a different runway. Better communication; seeing the red flag when a pilot questions anything. Not using a Hand set. Don't send and aircraft to the wrong runway.

We promptly executed the windshear escape procedure by checking max power; checking the spoilers were in; and following the windshear (WS)/go-around (GA) flight director commands. We experienced a slight decrease in airspeed and there was minimal roll caused by the windshear (or most likely wake turbulence). The windshear warning extinguished after several seconds and we quickly executed a right turn to intercept the RNAV course on the SID.

We were still south of the airport and at 3;000 feet when approach control vectored us off of the arrival to give us a right downwind heading for a 22L landing.  At this point the approach controller asked us if we had the airport in sight.  We confirmed with one another that the field was indeed in sight; and the captain told the controller that we had the field in sight.  We were then cleared for a visual approach to runway 22L.  At this point we were on a wide right downwind for the runway.  The captain said he would set in 1;500 feet as that was the final approach fix altitude for runway 22L.  I agreed and confirmed the selected altitude; and began a descent down.  Both the captain and myself had terrain selected on our NDs; and nothing indicated that we would have any issues.  As we were descending to 1;500 feet; somewhere around 1;700 feet or so we got a GPWS 'Terrain; pull up'.  At that same time the approach controller came on and told us that the minimum vectoring altitude in that area was 2;000 feet; of which we had no idea; and that we should climb back up to 2;000 feet. I had already begun climbing as the captain was resetting 2;000 feet.  As soon as I began initiating a climb the GPWS terrain warning went away.  I leveled the aircraft off at 2;000 feet; for a total climb of approximately 300 feet.  After we returned to 2;000 feet we continued with the visual approach to a normal landing on runway 22L without incident.",,"We were descending via the PHLBO arrival into to EWR when we were vectored off the arrival for a visual approach to runway 22L and given clearance to descend to 3000 ft. Approximately 10 miles SW of the airport NY Approach asked if we had the airport in sight. After conferring with the FO that we both were seeing the airport; I replied that we had the field in sight. At that time we were cleared for the visual approach to 22L. I set and confirmed an altitude of 1500 in the MCP for the planned FAF crossing at BUZZD. The FO began an Open Descent to 1500 and briefed that he would descend first and then slow the aircraft as we approached BUZZD on the base turn. As we descended through 2500 ft.; we were handed off to EWR Tower. Before checking in I observed some green terrain depictions on my ND and could see what appeared to be a dark area separating steady ground lighting out the window in front of us. Before I could contact EWR tower; they contacted us and advised us that we had descended below their MVA for that area and cleared us to climb to 2000 ft. for terrain. At this time we were at about 1700 ft. As we were receiving this advisory and clearance; the GPWS warning activated with 'terrain; terrain.' I was already setting 2000 ft. into the MCP window as the first officer initiated a climb; and as soon as we started the climb; the GPWS warning ceased. After leveling; the tower informed us that there was a ridge below us in that area; but that it was no longer a factor and we were re-cleared for the visual approach to 22L. The remainder of the approach and landing proceeded normally. The Threat in the case was obviously the terrain southwest of EWR. Our error was not being aware of that area of terrain; which resulted in an ATC low altitude warning and a GPWS activation which was a surprise to us both. While SOP would dictate performing the escape maneuver; we elected to not perform that maneuver in light of the fact that we had the conflicting terrain in sight and we had a corrective clearance from ATC for a climb to 2000 ft.; which was only 300 ft. above our current altitude. In my judgment; performing the full escape maneuver would have been far too aggressive for the correction needed and would have potentially placed us in conflict with our clearance and any overlying traffic. Instead; the FO disengaged the autopilot and auto thrust and performed an immediate; but normal climb to 2000 ft. at which time the GPWS warning ceased. It should be noted that the warning we received was a GPWS; not an EGPWS warning.Factors that contributed to our error would include accepting a night VMC visual approach clearance while 8 to 10 miles from the field; an assumption by me that terrain is not a threat in this area; so I was not concerned about the FO's descent and approach planning; and not giving more attention to the green EGPWS depiction on the NAV display. I have seen this before and I interpreted it to mean the terrain was well below us. While we did not receive any EGPWS warnings; clearly our proximity to the terrain was close enough to activate the radar altimeter based GPWS; at least momentarily.In the future I will not accept visual approaches at night unless we are established on or near the final approach course with a clear visual indication that terrain is not a factor for us. I will give more consideration to remaining at or above the airport's MSA until clearly in a position to establish a visual descent path to the runway on a visual approach. I will give more consideration to any EGPWS depictions of terrain in our path and not assume that a green depiction is a 'safely above' indication. While we did experience an unwanted aircraft state on this approach; the warnings received from both ATC and the GPWS system alerted us to our error and allowed us to correct out flight path in a timely manner.",,"A320 flight crew reported triggering a terrain warning from the GPWS when they descended below MVA on a night visual approach to RWY 22L at EWR.",

The Approach Controller also advised us that there were some red lights on the ground to the left of Runway 5; past Taxiway Foxtrot; that had the appearance of PAPI lights.  He advised us to ignore these lights.  We were glad that the Controller briefed us in advance of this issue.  As we flew our visual approach; backed up by the Runway 5 ILS; we noticed four distinct red lights situated in a horizontal line to the left of the touchdown zone.  The lights appeared to be PAPI lights (from left to right) in the red; red; red; red configuration ('RED on WHITE you're all right; RED on RED Pilot is dead.').  We confirmed that we were on the glidepath all the way to touchdown using the ILS.  However; the optical illusion of the four red lights (looked exactly like four red PAPI lights) caught our attention as we flew the approach.  Ignoring these four red lights was good advice from the Approach Controller.  However; doing so was like someone saying; 'Trust me; ignore the red traffic lights ahead; proceed through the intersection without regard for those red traffic lights.'  Flying an approach at night with what appears to be four red PAPI lights goes against everything a Pilot is trained 'not to do.'  After landing; we began our taxi to the gate and noticed a grouping of what appeared to be many temporary red lights in a construction zone in an area between Runway 5; Taxiway Foxtrot; Taxiway Mike; and Taxiway Mike 2.  On the ground the red lights took on a whole different appearance.  They did not look at all like PAPI lights; just a random grouping of red lights.  Somehow; when viewing the lights during an approach to Runway 5; these lights look exactly like four red PAPI lights.  I recommend that these lights be shielded or blocked in some way so that Pilots making the approach to CLT Runway 5 do not mistake the red construction lights for PAPI lights.",,,,"CLT TRACON alerted a flight crew that red airport lights to the left of Runway 5 appeared as false PAPI lights which at the time was inoperative.",

I acquired the A380 visually and watched as its flight path crossed over the top of us from left to right.  Because ATC had cautioned us on wake turbulence; the First Officer (FO) and I discussed the situation.  Our flight path was diverging from the A380; the winds at our altitude were off our left wing at 67 knots; we were two thousand feet below and the A380 was pulling away from us.  Comfortable with these factors; we remained on our current course.  Once the A380 had moved out in front of us; ATC cleared us to climb to FL 380.  The A380 was about eight to nine miles in front of us and diverging from our course.  After a while; ATC cleared the A380 direct to EWM VOR.  The A380 made a slight right turn to EWM and was diverging further from our flight track.  Shortly thereafter; ATC cleared us to climb to FL 390.  After leveling off at FL 390; I checked the winds; which were still off our left wing at 61 knots.  Although we were co-altitude with the A380; I felt comfortable with the situation because the A380 was moving further right of our flight track.  A short time later; ATC cleared us direct to ELP VOR.  Although we were to the left of the A380's flight track; the clearance to ELP VOR required a turn to the right; which put us about 15 miles in trail.  I checked the winds and noticed that they were now a quartering tailwind.  Just as I was about to discuss the situation with the FO; we encountered the A380's wake turbulence.  It initially started as choppy turbulence and then the aircraft rolled to the left.  Although the FO tried to counter the roll; the ailerons were ineffective in returning the aircraft back to level flight.  I estimate that the aircraft rolled about 30 to 35 degrees angle of bank.   We also lost about 400 feet; which was due in part to the turbulence and the FO trying to keep the aircraft from rolling any further.  I immediately contacted ATC and informed them that we were encountering the A380's turbulence and needed a descent and turn.  ATC gave us a right turn to a heading of 120 degrees (about 30 degrees) and a descent to FL 370.  Shortly after starting our turn and descent; the turbulence subsided.  We continued on the 120 heading until we felt we had enough of an offset.  ATC then cleared us back direct ELP VOR and we continued without any further incident.",,"Level at FL370; we noticed that we were following an Airbus 380 that was at FL390. We noticed that the winds were a direct left to right crosswind at about 40 knots. We were considering that due to wake turbulence. Once the A380 was between 10 and 15 miles in front of us; the Controller told us to climb and maintain FL390. This was the same altitude the A380 was flying. As soon as we leveled; our aircraft violently banked to the right roughly somewhere between 20 and 40 degrees of bank and shook the plane. I tried to correct the bank with the yoke and the ailerons were ineffective. The autopilot disengaged automatically and; in attempt to regain control of the aircraft; I realized I did have elevator control so I descended to get out of the wake turbulence. The non-flying Pilot was making ATC aware of the descent and reason. At 38;600' I regained control of the aircraft and leveled the plane. We asked for more spacing behind the A380.The loss of altitude was not a Pilot error. It was necessary to control the plane. Our mileage needed to be much farther behind an aircraft of that size to begin with.",,"B737-700 flight crew report encountering wake turbulence in trail of an A380 at FL390 that resulted in a 35 degree roll that could not be countered by ailerons.",

We were over the ocean when we experienced an UNABLE RNP FMC message.  On the FMC POS REF pages we noticed that we no longer had GPS reception; but there was no associated GPS1 or GPS2 EICAS message.  The RNP default value showed 2.0 and ANP was between 2.0 and 3.0; thus the UNABLE RNP message.  The Captain manually changed the RNP value to 12.0 and the UNABLE RNP message went away.  Shortly thereafter I deleted the manually selected RNP value and noticed that the default RNP value had returned to 12.0.  ANP slowly kept increasing; however it never exceeded 5.0.  The IRS (3) ACTUAL POS REF 2/4 at that time was around 11.0.  At landfall I watched ANP drop to 0.36.  Sometime later over land; I don't know when since I was on break sleeping; GPS reception resumed.    In the systems manual there is a note that states:  The FMC stops GPS updating if GPS data accuracy degrades due to satellite availability or unfavorable geometry.  Subsequently; the FMC receives updates from another system.  I have no way of knowing why GPS reception dropped off; but after the drop off the system functioned as designed.  I am guessing the RNP 2.0 value was there for a short time maybe because we crossed an ATS RNAV route. I was the IRO; but both the First Officer (FO) and I verified that both the post flight check IRS tolerances checks we do were within limits.      Suggestions:  1.

On the descent into ATL on the WARRR1 arrival. Given HONIE at 14;000 feet; 250 knots. Aircraft was previously assigned 300 knots. PF maintained a 3 degree descent rate until the last 15 miles; then reduced thrust to idle and shallowed out descent rate to slow down. We leveled off at 14;000 feet about 9 miles prior to HONIE and began a speed reduction to 250 knots. At HONIE we encountered wake turbulence. This was apparent as the weather was not providing any turbulence and the aircraft started rocking in a roll motion. First encounter autopilot stayed on with about 10 degrees of bank; lasted 5 seconds. About 15 seconds later; encountered it again; this time 20 degrees of bank to the left.

The aircraft causing the wake was a 737-700 model aircraft. During the descent and arrival we had a tail wind around 47knots. Distance on the TCAS with the aircraft was 5 miles. The 737 could have been high on the arrival; putting us in the situation where we encountered the wake. Separation looked normal coming on the arrival.

Traffic had been busy all day and mostly complex; definitely a busy day. Runway 13 was in use at the airport and visual approaches were being utilized. Aircraft X was an IFR on a left downwind for PSP. My trainee cleared Aircraft X for a visual approach to runway 13R like normal. Aircraft X turned base approx. 8 miles NE of the airport and was descending. Multiple other things were going on around the airspace forcing both the trainee and I to keep our scans going all around the airspace. My trainee picked up a target exiting the Banning Pass (mountain pass approx. 15 miles west of PSP) low level (I believe at 4;000 feet in a slow descent) and issued traffic to Aircraft X.  Aircraft X acknowledged the traffic. Only a few seconds went by before I stepped in and issued a traffic alert to Aircraft X and told them to maintain 4;000 feet. At the time I issued the traffic alert; the radar showed Aircraft X at 4;100 feet and the unidentified target at 3;500 feet. Aircraft X responded 'We're already through 4;000 feet '. I don't remember the exact time that Aircraft Y called us for advisories; but he said where he was and his altitude; and I immediately knew that the target was him. Aircraft X said 'We're descending'. I believe I said 'Aircraft Y on frequency descend to 2;500 feet immediately; do you have the aircraft at 11 o'clock and a half mile in sight?' I received no response; but I observed the target descending rapidly. I received no word from Aircraft X on if they were responding to an RA; which is why I continued to try and resolve the situation. At this time; both aircraft were in rapid descents to try and avoid each other; one listening to my recommendation; and the other not. I found out later that Aircraft X had responded to three RAs; but did not advise me; which to me is understandable given the altitude and the proximity. I observed both targets merge; one showed 2;200 and one showed 2;300.Aircraft X finally came back and said 'OK; we got him now; he's right over the top of us'. The pilot for Aircraft X said they would like to be re-sequenced for an approach in which I complied. I took over for the trainee until Aircraft X was switched to the tower. Radar coverage in the Banning Pass is non-existent below 6;000 feet. We can pick up aircraft around the pass if they are at 5;500 to 5;000 feet; but they usually are intermittent hits. At 4;500 feet and below; our radar will only pick them up once they are at the intersection of Interstate 10 and Highway 111. This intersection is absolutely in the arrival corridor for PSP when they are landing 13R. It's also right in the departure corridor for 31L. This is about here we picked up Aircraft Y on radar. However; when we are working other aircraft; our scan cannot be on one spot 100% of the time.  The trainee picked up the target in time to issue traffic; but his lack of experience led to him not giving a traffic alert right away; which is why I stepped in. Aircraft Y did not call us for advisories when in the pass; where we could have given him instructions to remain clear of the arrival corridor; and by the time he called; the scenario was already happening.  There is no requirement for Aircraft Y to call. Aircraft Y was more than legal being where he was; even though he was in the TRSA; participation is entirely optional on the part of the pilot. PSP is a slow airport in the summer time; but a very busy airport; not just for IFR's; in the winter. My recommendation is to create a Class C airspace around the PSP airport that would protect these aircraft from VFR pilots transitioning through their area. Protect the arrival and departure corridors for these aircraft who do not have much room to maneuver due to terrain. The TRSA around the airport does absolutely nothing to promote safety and protect the aircraft trying to take off and land at PSP. This may be my first report on the issue; butit is definitely not the first time a target has appeared from Banning and converged with an aircraft attempting to land at PSP. I'm not sure how many other reports have been filed for this problem; but it is absolutely a dangerous situation.",,"I was training on Desert Radar when I cleared Aircraft X for a visual approach to runway 13R at PSP. There was an unidentified VFR aircraft that popped up at 3;500 feet coming out of the Banning pass northwest of PSP. There is no radar coverage for aircraft in the Banning pass below about 5;000 feet. I issued traffic to Aircraft X. When Aircraft X was about 2 miles from the traffic my instructor keyed up and told Aircraft X to maintain 4;000. Aircraft X advised that they were currently descending through 4;000. That is when Aircraft Y called up for flight following. My instructor told Aircraft Y to descend immediately. Aircraft X kept descending responding to an RA. Both targets were indicating about 2;500 feet when the targets merged. Aircraft X reported seeing Aircraft Y in a steep climb to just make it over their aircraft. Aircraft X then said they would need to abandon the approach and was vectored back around for another approach.There is currently a TRSA over PSP. Aircraft Y was skirting around the 4 mile Class D that surrounds PSP before eventually calling ATC because they saw Aircraft X heading right at them. There needs to be a Class C at PSP. The TRSA is useless for protecting aircraft departing and arriving to PSP. Aircraft are not currently required to call ATC for transition through the TRSA. It is only a matter of time before one of these VFR aircraft hit an airliner arriving or departing PSP. The area surrounding PSP during the winter months has a very heavy volume of VFR aircraft. Most of the VFR aircraft do not call for flight following leading to dangerous situations regularly for the IFR aircraft in the vicinity of PSP airport. There are only a few TRSA's left in the country; I feel that is because everyone has realized how useless they are at keeping departing and arriving airliners safe from VFR aircraft not talking to ATC.",,"Four reports from an SCT Controller providing training; his trainee Controller and the crew of an airline aircraft documenting a near mid-air caused by an aircraft coming out of the Banning Pass and conflicting with the airliner turning final for PSP.",

Winds at the time were virtually calm; and we received the clearance for takeoff before the Airbus was barely down the runway; which I believe is improper.  I waited a few moments for the Airbus to depart and give a little spacing between us.  I considered wake issues pre-takeoff roll; and made efforts to avoid by climbing above the preceding aircraft's flightpath that rotated way beyond us; but we were unable to out-climb it.  We encountered the rolling moment from the Airbus's wake very soon at about 500 feet AGL on climb out. I corrected with left aileron inputs that did little to overcome the sharp rolling moment to the right from the wake - it was strong.  At maximum; I had near full aileron deflection left to overcome the right rolling moment and that barely held zero roll at 30+ degrees; although we were at about 30-40 degrees right bank.  Because of our low alt (about 500-700 AGL) I could not reduce altitude to escape the wake; and we were at min climb speed; about 160-180 knots; I could not do much to escape the wake other than change heading as I could not climb above it; I could not descend below it; and could not power out of it; so we moved about 15 degrees left; to about a 185 heading. Immediately we exited the wake and contacted ATC to alert them to our encounter and our deviation of heading.  We continued on that heading at the direction of ATC for a while and was eventually cleared direct to our initial fix and to Center.  That was the end of the incident; which in my view was not minor; but necessary under the conditions at the time. The whole event lasted less than 5-7 seconds in my opinion.ATC won't change its policy of blasting off aircraft into the wakes of larger aircraft; so little can be written to change minds on that subject; but our experience is an example that wake from larger aircraft actually does affect smaller aircraft even if it is inconvenient for ATC's spacing protocols.

The throttles are much tighter /harder to move than they should be. In most cases the friction lock will not even move; if it does; it doesn't loosen the throttles at all. Whenever I have throttles like this the thrust reversers are almost always even tighter. In a few instances the thrust [reverser] levers are so tight that the only way I would be able to physically deploy them would be to intentionally injure my wrist (due to the strength that would be required). As we do not test the thrust reversers; this problem is not found until the landing roll. The threat [is] finding out that the thrust levers cannot be pulled at a time when you are counting on them; i.e. on a short or contaminated runway. Other crews do not write them up; because while they might seem tight; they are still able to deploy them.

The signage and the Jeppessen chart displayed in the cockpit did not clearly depict where Y11 began and ended. I should have recognized the confusion; and asked ATC for clarification; but instead turned onto Y11 and proceeded to the end of it. As I recall; the Y11 sign to our right had an arrow pointing left; and there was another Y11 sign near the Q stub to runway 30; placed at an angle that made it look like it was only the stub portion ahead; so I momentarily thought Y11 was actually just the short stub leading to Q and we were on the holding block area.I held short of Q; which I thought was holding short of the short stub Y11.Ground Control notified us of our error; and we asked if they would like us to taxi away and onto the holding block; and they said to just hold our position; which we did. There was only one other aircraft in the area; and they must have been well behind us or to our right; because they were cleared around us via Y and Q to takeoff ahead of us. There were no potential conflicts with other aircraft; but it was very disconcerting to have made this error when we were trying to do the right thing.The NOS chart and Jeppesen chart depict Y11 only to the west of Z; so [as it appears on the Jeppesen chart; Y11 short of Taxiway Q] looks like a stub [off] the holding block. Painting Y11 with an arrow on the taxiway surface itself would alleviate this confusion; because the entire area is paved; and it seems like we are on a holding block when we are actually utilizing a portion of that holding block as Y11. They could also paint a sideline paralleling the taxiway centerline to represent the width of taxiway Y11; and differentiate it from the holding block.The Jeppesen and NOS charts should also depict Y11 as running the entire length of the south end of the holding block by printing Y11 twice along that segment; as they have done with taxiways Q; U; Z; and J elsewhere on the chart.",,,,"A Falcon flight crew cleared from the IAD General Aviation ramp to Runway 30 via Z; hold short of Y11 failed to note that the south end of the 'HOLD BLOCK' just prior to the Runway 30/parallel Taxiway Q complex; through which Z traverses is technically Taxiway Y11.

The controller expressed displeasure at our inability to maintain 250 kts.  Further coordination resulted in a speed of 230 kts but frequency congestion prevented better communication of the situation.

After being cleared direct to MAVEK; the plane began a slight banking to the left and right while continuing direct to MAVEK. Within a few seconds of crossing MAVEK; approach queried us on our position as they showed us almost 2 miles off course. They issued us a vector of 140 to join the 164 radial off SMO. At this point the aircraft was still in NAV mode and showed it was turning to join the assigned course. However approach quickly queried us a second time to inform us we were now 3 miles off course and below the assigned minimum altitude for the area. Approach assigned a further left turn and told us to maintain VFR and to join the final approach course on this heading. At this point I; as pilot monitoring switched to 'green needles' and saw we were too far to the right and full scale deflection on the 164 radial from SMO. Right about this point the Captain disconnected the autopilot to join the final approach course as was shown on the FMS. The FMS showed us to be very high on a short final to runway 5R which did not add up to what our position and distance off the SMO radial showed. At this point I noticed a 'FMS DR' flag on our MFD. Upon seeing this I immediately called for a go around. The Captain immediately added power and began a climb. As we were climbing we reported a navigation failure to the approach controller. He instructed us to turn to a heading of 050 and to climb and maintain 12;000. Shortly after; he gave us a further clearance to turn direct to the SLM VOR and hold as published. At this point we once again had navigation troubles as the FMS was directing us in one direction while the approach controller was directing us in another. After tuning the SLM VOR we proceeded directly to the VOR and held without further navigational problems. At this point I ran the QRH for a Position Unknown which was the correct QRH to run for a FMS DR flag. This instructed us to inhibit GPWS terrain. While in holding; the FMS navigational performance degraded further and displayed 'FMS DR 5.0NM.' According to the MFD; our position was displayed nearly thirty miles from the SLM VOR where we were holding.The root cause was the failure of the GPS as we crossed the IAF of the RNAV/ILS 5R approach. By the time we had been alerted to the problem; we were already several miles off course.A contributing factor was MAVEK depicted as a flyover waypoint. Because of this we expected to cross over MAVEK with some overshoot as is natural of a flyover waypoint.I have experienced the aircraft bank to the left and right repeatedly only one other time. This was when the military was jamming GPS. In that instance we merely deselected the GPS and allowed the aircraft to continue strictly on RNAV equipment. In the future; if I begin to feel the aircraft waver on a course again I will make sure to immediately check the GPS equipment and RNP and to ensure we have adequate performance. Additionally I will cross check using ground based navigation aids.",,,,"A GPS failure went undetected on the MMMX AVSAR4A Arrival until ATC issued heading and altitude vectors.

Unfortunately; I didn't hear the speed assignment. I started to slow prior to reaching the 4 nm point. Prior to turning on final; we had an auto throttle failure. The failure happened during the descent on base leg. We made two attempts to re-engage the auto throttles but we were unable to recover the system. When we turned and intercepted the localizer and were cleared for the approach; it was obvious we were gaining on the heavy traffic in front of us. We were 3.5 nm behind the heavy and picking up wake turbulence. I speculate this is when we were given the speed restriction. While clearing the runway; ATC asked why we started to slow to our final approach speed early. We told the tower we started slowing because we were picking up turbulence from the heavy aircraft in from of us.  I believe I missed the speed restriction because of three distractions in the cockpit. Auto throttle failure; wake turbulence and a loss of separation behind the heavy aircraft. When I heard the approach clearance; I assumed responsibility for wake turbulence separation. I was aware of the [policy] pertaining to expected speed restrictions on final. When I saw the loss of separation; we should have queried ATC about any speed restrictions.",,,,"B767 reported encountering wake turbulence in trail of a heavy jet on approach to EGLL.

The airport diagram depicts the taxiways with what appears to be separated taxiways; whereas in real life it's a solid ramp area. We overshot Taxiway J and got into a position of not being able to turn onto; thus we had to use Taxiway B.  This was the first time either of us had been at that end of the airport and it was very confusing for the first time. I suspect it happens regularly because another carrier's two arrivals behind us did exactly the same thing we did as we waited on ramp traffic in front of us.I would suggest painting in the areas separating the taxiways; like many airports have a green color. Something to better depict the taxiway. Although I don't suspect I will make the same mistake having experienced this. My concern was uncertainty clearing across over concrete ramp to Taxiway J.","The reporter stated that after landing on Runway 29; his first time ever; he was expecting either grass or clear demarcations between taxiways. That was not the case; and in fact the taxiways are connected by massive concrete open areas which make the taxiways indistinguishable from non-taxiways. He would suggest a chart redesign which more clearly depicts the connected ramp; taxiway network. The reporter believes the chart should clearly show the ramp areas; where they in fact exist; but dashed taxiway lines where taxiways exist (such as currently shown for Taxiway B at the Ball Park). When he received clearance across the ramp to Taxiway J; his mind boggled because the real world did not fit the expectation he had developed from studying the airport diagram.",,,"After landing on and clearing EWR Runway 29; a flight crew was cleared across the open ramp to Taxiway J.

Also we started to experience wake turbulence from the heavy aircraft in front of us and separation looked close. The Captain instinctively slowed to target speed just prior to 4 DME to maintain safe operation of the approach. After landing Ground Control queried why we slowed down.

It appeared that the autopilot was not going to level off at the assigned altitude. Both the First Officer (FO) and myself reached for the controls and disconnected both the autopilot and autothrottles.At about the same time the Captain's primary flight display (PFD) started showing mulitple erratic indications on both airspeed and altimeter. These were accompanied by multiple aural alerts. I switched the flying duties to the FO's side while getting out the QRH. Nothing could be found; at first; in the QRH that matched our situation. I went to the airspeed unreliable checklist first but other items were failing so we weren't sure if that was the correct check list to follow.We notified ATC that we had some navigational problems and inquired about our course.  They said our altitude was erratic and showing quick changes from 38;000 feet. We switched to our number 2 transponder to see if that would solve the problem. Center then showed us level at 38;000 feet. Then I got a unable required Nav Perf-RNP. Both the RNP and ANP were amber. I went to the POS page 2 and saw that our IRS were drifting apart. Left side showed 13 miles while the right side showed 5 miles and drifting even more apart. We inquired about our track and was told it appeared we were drifting off course. We requested a vector to a nearby vortac. This was given and told to proceed when able.About that time I got an IRS fault and again checking the POS page 2 saw that I had lost the left IRS. Followed the QRH I switched the IRS to both on the right side. Nothing happened to my PFD and the FO's PFD started to drift off making his side worse. I switched the IRS back to the normal position and for a short time that fixed the FO's instruments.I called both Dispatch and Maintenance Control advising them of the situation. By this time we had been hand flying and the navigational instruments were in question. I informed both that we were going to return to the departure airport. Dispatch re-dispatched us for our return via ACARS. We advised ATC of our intentions and were given a heading back. We noticed that our standby heading indicator was showing us on a 120 heading while we were still flying a 300 heading. It also had a flag showing it was inop.As soon as the FO started his turn we received two uncommanded rudder inputs causing a sharp roll to the left. The captains instruments were showing both pitch and bank angle in excess and was getting both aural alerts to each. Then my PFD went blank since I still had the overhead switch in the normal position on the IRS.After the uncommanded rudder input I advised ATC that we were no longer RVSM qualified. We requested a lower altitude and was assigned flight level 280. As we started the descent we realized that 28;000 would put in IMC. Not wanting to go IMC with our faulty navigational instruments I requested to stop at 34;000 to stay VMC and that was approved.We checked weather at several different locations but none had the weather we felt comfortable flying in considering our current problems. We flew back to our departure airport via radar vectors and using our whiskey compass. Weather at our departure airport was VMC and we knew a visual approach could be made easily. Both the FO and myself took turns doing the flying. We elected not to trim or change the configuration of the aircraft since we weren't sure exactly what was wrong with the jet and what caused the rudder input to roll the plane. We talked about our approach and how we would configure the plane for landing.Since we had uncommanded input to the rudder we elected not to arm the speed brake for fear of early deployment. Flaps would be at 15 for a higher approach speed in case of a hard rudder throw. The ground prox flap inhibit switch was turned off used the single engine check list since that covered our abnormal landing configuration. Autobrakes 3 were selected but they had failed too. Autobrakes were turned off and normal braking was to be used.While descending through 12;000 feet on our approach we experienced a third and more violent roll to the left; again caused by a uncommanded rudder input. At this point I instructed the FO to turn off the yaw damper. While on approach we still were receiving many false warnings concerning airspeed and windshear. The Captain's barber pole and yellow stall indicator were touching during the approach. After touch down the Captain's stick shaker went off throughout the roll out. After clearing the runway we taxied to the gate. The taxi in was uneventful.All decisions made were based on the interest of safety. At no time did we deviate from any altitude; clearance; or FARs.","The reporter stated that the Captain's PFD was ultimately blank. The only heading source available was the wet compass which the crew was not certain they could trust. After the flight; passengers and flight attendants reported several significant rudder 'kicks'; several more than the crew experienced. Maintenance reported an IRS transfer switch anomaly was apparently the cause. That component was replaced and the aircraft returned to service.","[Report narrative contained no additional information].",,"A B737-700 autopilot transitioned to Control Wheel Steering uncommanded; followed by the loss of both IRS; erratic airspeed; altimeter; pitch and bank indications as well as intermittent uncommanded rudder inputs.

We passed Taxiway B on our rollout due to another aircraft being on it; and we thought; blocking our exit. We later figured out Taxiway B is the ONLY useable taxiway onto the terminal ramp.  We continued down the runway to taxiway C where we saw a number of barricades and did not think we could taxi any further without getting stuck due to barricades. We then continued down Runway 17/35 to the intersection of it and Runway 3/21. At that point we did not see any barricades blocking our turn onto the closed runway and thought it was open for taxi only. There was a NOTAM for Runway 3/21 stating it was closed; but nothing telling us we could not use it for taxi. Being based elsewhere; we used a closed runway for taxi all the time; it is our norm. As we continued down 3/21 someone spoke to us on the CTAF frequency stating we had to do a 180 and taxi back on 17/35 to get to the ramp. We did; and exited B to taxi across Runway 3/21 to get to the ramp.  Again; there was poor signage and barricades not clearly marking where we could not taxi.

Someone in the tower recognized our confusion and directed us to back taxi down runway 17 to taxi way B which crosses the closed runway and then taxi way A to the ramp.
